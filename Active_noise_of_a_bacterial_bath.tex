\begin{abstract}
The interplay between complex environments and active matter suggests a possibility to control and engineer active matter by carefully designing the confinement structures.
It is now well established that confinement may influence transport, rheology, pressure, spatial distribution and collective motion of active matter.
Curved confining walls, which are ubiquitous in biological systems, show their own, specific rich and intriguing effects on active matter.
Here, using a double emulsion system, where the inner and outer droplet sizes can be independently controlled, we experimentally investigate the influence of curved confinement on an active bath of \textit{Escherichia coli} (\ecoli) bacteria.
In particular, we analyze the fluctuations of the inner droplet using the framework of a stochastic ``active noise'' model, and show that the strength of active noise is not an intrinsic property of an active bath, but depends on the confinement curvature.
\textcolor{red}{Our numerical simulations revealed the origin of this dependence on confinement.}
Our results pose new challenge to active matter theory and suggest new methods to control active matter.

\section{Introduction}
% Use "Active noise" key word to label all the literatures related to this project
The interactions between active and passive objects are always intriguing. 
On the one hand, passive objects are often used as a probe to assess the properties, in particular activity, which are sometimes challenging to measure directly.
On the other hand, the capabilities of activity to ehance mixing of fluids and transport of nutrients show great ecological significance and can potentially enable important biomedical applications \cite{Kurtuldu2011, Pushkin2013, Saintillan2008a, Sokolov2009a}.

On the most elementary level, the interaction between an active particle and a passive particle can be described as ``scattering''.
In this process, the active particle swims by the passive particle results in a closed-loop trajectory, due to the hydrodynamic head-rear symmetry of the model swimmer \cite{Dunkel2010}.
In the presence of a confining wall, the flow field generated by an active swimmer is modified, as if there is a mirror image of the swimmer, with force singularities pointing in opposite directions \cite{Blake1974}.
The head-rear symmetry is broken in the modified flow field, leading to net displacement of passive object in a single scattering event.
Based on this picture, Mino et al. successfully modeled the confinement effect on the diffusivity of passive particles in active bath \cite{Mino2011, Mino2013}.
\citet{Lagarde2020} focused their experiment more on the single scattering event, and found far field hydrodynamic interactions to be irrelevant compared to direct collisions.
The experiments mentioned above all revealed an important aspect of active baths: the effect on passive tracer diffusivity is stochastic and additive.
This discovery has led to efforts to model active baths as a stochastic noise \cite{Gregoire2001, Maggi2014, Wu2000, Ye2020}.

Boundaries are known to have dramatic impact on active matter, with examples of pattern formation, directed flow and unusual mechanical properties \cite{Wioland2013, Wu2017, Liu2019}.
Planar boundaries, which are common and easy to produce in labs, have been studied extensively in the past two decades.
However, less is known about how curved boundaries affect active matter behavior.

In this paper, we experimentally investigate this question by putting active bacterial suspensions into the middle layer (also know as the ``shell'' layer) of oil-water-oil double emulsions.
We analyze the fluctuations of the inner droplet using the framework of a stochastic ``active noise'' model, and show that the strength of active noise is not an intrinsic property of an active bath, but depends on the confinement curvature.
\textcolor{red}{Furthermore, we show that the dependence on confinement originates from two aspects: collision angle and activity. Our numerical simulations reveal the origin how spherical confining wall reduces the activity of an active bath.}
Our results deepen the understanding of active matter behavior under confinement.

Bacterial Culture:
Here we used wild-type e.coli bacteria (strain  W3110). The bacteria were grown with a standard culturing protocol, 10 $\mu L$ of frozen stock stored at -20 degrees is diluted in 10 $mL$ of lysogenic broth (LB) and put on a shaker at a temperature 30º and 210 rpm overnight. 
The saturated culture is diluted in a proportion of $1:100$ in LB medium and let it grow until the mid-log phase of growth, which is equivalent to an optical density ($OD_{600}$) $\approx$ 0.6. 
Cells were harvested at 2100 $g$ for 10 min. 
Then the supernatant is removed, and the pellet is resuspended in a minimal motility buffer (MMA).
 This allows the bacteria to swim but do not divide. Next, a volume of $10 \mu L$ is added in $1 mL$ of Hexadecane containing 2\% weight Span 80 as a surfactant. The mixture is manually agitated and diluted 1:10 in 1 mL of Hexadecane. Then 200 $uL$ of the emulsion is put in a square observation chamber of $L = 1 cm$  and height $h=400\mu m$. The chamber is fabricated in a SU-8 photoresist (Gersteltec GM 1075) with optical lithography on a 50.8 $mm$ diameter glass wafer. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Inner droplet trajectories}
\textcolor{blue}{
In this section, we report the results of inner droplet trajectories.
It should include the trajectory illustration, variance time series, displacement PDF, MSD and perhaps more.

  (c) Displacement probability density function (PDF) in $y$ direction, at various time interval $\Delta t$.
  (d) Displacement PDF, where the displacement $\Delta y$ is rescaled by the square root of time interval $\Delta t^{1/2}$.
  (e) Mean square displacement (MSD) of all inner droplet trajectories in this study, with time rescaled by fitted relaxation time $\tau^*$ and MSD rescaled by the product of active diffusivity and relaxation time $D_A\tau^*$.
  (f) A fit of MSD data to our 1D model, fitting parameters are $D_A=1.95$ $\mu$m$^2$/s, $\tau=0.25$ s, $\tau^*=4.40$ s and $c=0.086$ $\mu$m$^2$/s.

\subsection{Bacterial activity}
\textcolor{blue}{
In this section, we report the bacterial activity measurement by PIV and particle tracking.
It should include mean velocity as a function of droplet size and OD, as well as spatial velocity profiles in various conditions.
}
\subsection{Droplet lifetime}
\textcolor{blue}{
In this section, we report the time dependence of droplet activity, in particular the ``frozen droplet'' phenomenon.
We hope to use this phenomenon as a support of our argument that confinement affects bacterial activity.
However, even if this support turns out to be weak, we still can publish this phenomenon on its own, because it's new.

\subsection{Numerical simulation}
% Idea is to align some simulation results with experimental results.
% The current simulation is good on its own, but lacks some alignment with experiment, for example the parameters.
% If there are new results from simulation, we can get together to discuss what to include in this section.
