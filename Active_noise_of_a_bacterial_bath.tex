\begin{abstract}
The interplay between complex environments and active matter suggests a possibility to control and engineer active matter by carefully designing the confinement structures.
It is now well established that confinement may influence transport, rheology, pressure, spatial distribution and collective motion of active matter.
Curved confining walls, which are ubiquitous in biological systems, show their own, specific rich and intriguing effects on active matter.
Here, using a double emulsion system, where the inner and outer droplet sizes can be independently controlled, we experimentally investigate the influence of curved confinement on an active bath of \textit{Escherichia coli} (\ecoli) bacteria.
In particular, we analyze the fluctuations of the inner droplet using the framework of a stochastic ``active noise'' model, and show that the strength of active noise is not an intrinsic property of an active bath, but depends on the confinement curvature.
\textcolor{red}{Our numerical simulations revealed the origin of this dependence on confinement.}
Our results pose new challenge to active matter theory and suggest new methods to control active matter.

\section{Introduction}
% Use "Active noise" key word to label all the literatures related to this project
The interactions between active and passive objects are always intriguing.
On the one hand, passive objects are often used as a probe to assess the properties, in particular activity, which are sometimes challenging to measure directly.
On the other hand, the capabilities of activity to ehance mixing of fluids and transport of nutrients show great ecological significance and can potentially enable important biomedical applications \cite{Kurtuldu2011, Pushkin2013, Saintillan2008a, Sokolov2009a}.

On the most elementary level, the interaction between an active particle and a passive particle can be described as ``scattering''.
In this process, the active particle swims by the passive particle results in a closed-loop trajectory, due to the hydrodynamic head-rear symmetry of the model swimmer \cite{Dunkel2010}.
In the presence of a confining wall, the flow field generated by an active swimmer is modified, as if there is a mirror image of the swimmer, with force singularities pointing in opposite directions \cite{Blake1974}.
The head-rear symmetry is broken in the modified flow field, leading to net displacement of passive object in a single scattering event.
Based on this picture, Mino et al. successfully modeled the confinement effect on the diffusivity of passive particles in active bath \cite{Mino2011, Mino2013}.
\citet{Lagarde2020} focused their experiment more on the single scattering event, and found far field hydrodynamic interactions to be irrelevant compared to direct collisions.
The experiments mentioned above all revealed an important aspect of active baths: the effect on passive tracer diffusivity is stochastic and additive.
This discovery has led to efforts to model active baths as a stochastic noise \cite{Gregoire2001, Maggi2014, Wu2000, Ye2020}.

Boundaries are known to have dramatic impact on active matter, with examples of pattern formation, directed flow and unusual mechanical properties \cite{Wioland2013, Wu2017, Liu2019}.
Planar boundaries, which are common and easy to produce in labs, have been studied extensively in the past two decades.
However, less is known about how curved boundaries affect active matter behavior.

In this paper, we experimentally investigate this question by putting active bacterial suspensions into the middle layer (also know as the ``shell'' layer) of oil-water-oil double emulsions.
We analyze the fluctuations of the inner droplet using the framework of a stochastic ``active noise'' model, and show that the strength of active noise is not an intrinsic property of an active bath, but depends on the confinement curvature.
\textcolor{red}{Furthermore, we show that the dependence on confinement originates from two aspects: collision angle and activity. Our numerical simulations reveal the origin how spherical confining wall reduces the activity of an active bath.}
Our results deepen the understanding of active matter behavior under confinement.

\subsection{Bacterial culture}

Wild-type \ecoli bacteria (strain  W3110) were grown with a standard culturing protocol \cite{Keymer2008}.
10 \ul~of frozen stock stored at -20\degreec~was diluted in 10 ml of lysogenic broth (LB) and incubated overnight in a shaking incubator at temperature 30\degreec~and 210 rpm. 
The overnight culture was then diluted in 100 times in LB and let grow for 3.5 hours to reach the optical density at 600 nm (OD) of $0.6\pm 0.1$. 
Bacteria were harvested by centrifuging the suspensions at 2100 $g$ for 10 min. 
Then the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimal motility buffer, MMA (10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA and 10 mM sodium lactate \cite{Minamino2003}).
\textcolor{red}{In the droplet experiments, I used the MB described in Eric's protocol. The most nominal difference is the addition of L-serine.} 
In MMA, bacteria are allowed to swim, but not to divide. 
The final concentration of the bacterial suspensions ranges from $OD = 0.7$ to $OD = 100$.
\subsection{Double emulsion}

Double emulsions were produced by mechanical mixing of the aqueous bacterial suspension and hexadecane (Sigma-Aldrich, H6703).
10 \ul~bacterial suspension was added to 1 ml hexadecane containing 2 wt\% Span 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, S6760) as a surfractant. 
1 wt\% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, $M_w$ 13,000-23,000, Sigma-Aldrich, 363170) was supplemented to the oil phase to stabilize the inner droplets.
The mixture is mannually agitated to form many aqueous droplets in oil, among which 10\% are with another oil droplet inside.
Since this is an emulsion inside another emulsion, we term this experimental system a double emulsion, which is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{montaje_doble}(a).
The double emulsion was then diluted 1:10 in hexadecane for observaton.
This dilution ensured enough space between droplets, so that hydrodynamic interactions can be neglected. 

\subsection{Microscopy}

The same photoprinted square observation chamber was used in this work (described in \citet{Ramos2020}).
The chamber was loaded with 200~\ul~of the double emulsion and subsequently sealed with a coverslip to minimize evaporation.
Due to density mismatch between water and hexadecane, the aqueous droplets sedimented to the bottom of the chamber, while the inner oil droplets floated to the top of the aqueous droplets.  
The chamber was then placed on an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-XX) and the double emulsions were filmed with XX camera at 50-70 Hz.
The $xz$-plane observation was achieved by a microscope sitting on a rotating ``cradle'' (described in XX). 
Magnifications ranging from 20X to 60X were used in our experiments, depending on the size of the droplets. 
Figures~\ref{montaje_doble}(b) and (c) show some snapshots of $xy$-plane and $xz$-plane videos, respectively. 

\subsection{Image analysis}

Droplet tracking was done with a method based on Hough Transform (HT), a common technique for feature extraction \cite{Stockman2001}. 
The results were refined by a custom Python code, which will be discussed in the appendix.
Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was performed using OpenPIV package in Python \cite{OpenPIV}, for characterizing bacterial activity in droplets.

\section{1D model}
% I rewrite the 1D model part based on the overleaf version to serve as a reference for the discussions of the results.

To model the experiment, we consider the inner droplet as a passive particle agitated by an active noise.
The outer droplet imposes confinement on the inner droplet.
For a small displacement from the equilibrium point, the effect of the curved surface can be approximated by a harmonic potential.
The equation of motion for the inner droplet in the Low Reynolds number limit is the overdamped Langevin equation:
%
\begin{align}
    \label{eq.Langevin}
    \dot{x}=u(t)-\frac{x}{\tilde{\tau}}.
\end{align}
%
where $\tilde{\tau}=\Gamma/k$, with $\Gamma$ the friction coefficient, $k$ the spring constant for the harmonic potential, and $u(t)$ is the active noise induced by the bacterial suspension.
We will model the active noise as a colored Gaussian noise, with the following statistical properties:
%
\begin{align}
    \label{eq.act.noise}
    \langle u(t)\rangle &=0,\\
    \langle u(t)u(t')\rangle &=\frac{\tilde{D}}{\tau}e^{-|t-t'|/\tau}.
\end{align}
%
where $\tilde{D}$ is the active diffusion coefficient, and $\tau$ is the persistence time of the bacterial fluxes. The solution of the eq(\ref{eq.Langevin}) is given by:
%
\begin{align}
    \label{sol:langevin}
    x(t) = x_oe^{-t/\tilde{\tau}}+\int_{0}^{\infty}ds e^{-|t-s|/\tilde{\tau}}u(s).
\end{align}

We can derive the mean-square displacement (MSD):
%
\begin{align}
    \label{eq.MSD_1d}
    \langle \Delta x^2(t)\rangle = \frac{2(\tilde{D}/\tau)}{\frac{1}{\tilde{\tau}}+\frac{1}{\tau}}\left(\frac{1-e^{-\frac{2t}{\tilde{\tau}}}}{\frac{2}{\tilde{\tau}}}-\frac{e^{-(\frac{1}{\tilde{\tau}}+\frac{1}{\tau})t}-e^{-\frac{2t}{\tilde{\tau}}}}{\frac{1}{\tilde{\tau}}-\frac{1}{\tau}}\right),
\end{align}
%
with the short and long time limits given by:
%
\begin{align}
    \label{eq.limits}
    \lim_{t\to0} \langle \Delta x^2(t)\rangle & = \frac{\tilde{D}}{\tau}t^2,\\
    \lim_{t\to\infty} \langle \Delta x^2(t)\rangle & =\frac{\tilde{D}(\tau^*)^2}{\tilde{\tau}+\tau}.
\end{align}
%
We can see that the MSD is ballistic at short times andsaturates to a constant value at long times due to the confinement imposed by the harmonic potential. In Fig.~\ref{fig:msd-1d-model} we show two plots of the Eq.~\ref{eq.MSD_1d} for different values of $\tilde{\tau}$ while keeping $\tau$ fixed, and different $\tau$ while keeping $\tilde{\tau}$ fixed.

\begin{figure}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Inner droplet trajectories}

In the double emulsion experimental system, the inner droplet is frequently ``kicked'' by the many swimming bacteria around it.
As a result, it exhibits fluctuations much stronger than Brownian motion in the horizontal ($y$) direction.
Due to the smaller density of the inner droplet relative to the bacterial suspension, a buoyant force is constantly pushing it to the top surface of the outer droplet, making the dome an equilibrium position.
In the vertical ($z$) direction, the inner droplet mostly follows the outer droplet surface.
A typical inner droplet trajectory is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(a).
The colored dots denote the positions of inner droplet center at different time.
In cases where inner droplet size is very small, while the bacterial activity is large, inner droplet can leave the surface.
We can roughly estimate the critical inner droplet radius, below which bacterial activity can overcome buoyant force.
The buoyant force is $F_b = \frac{4}{3}\pi r_i^3\Delta\rho g$, where $\Delta\rho\approx 230$ kg/m$^3$ is the density difference between water and hexadecane, and $g\approx 9.8$ m/s$^2$ is the gravitational accelaration.
The propelling force of a single bacteria is approximated by the Stokes drag on a sphere $F_a \approx 6\pi\eta r_b V_b$, where $\eta=0.001$ Pa$\cdot$s is water viscosity, $r_b\approx 0.5$ $\mu$m is bacteria cross section radius and $V_b \approx 20$ $\mu$m/s is the simming speed of bacteria.
Let $F_b=F_a$, we get a critical droplet radius $r_c \approx 2.7$ $\mu$m.
Indeed, since we never prepared inner droplet with radius $r_i < r_c$, inner droplet leaving the surface is a rare event.
However, in very concentrated bacterial suspensions, the inner droplet can leave the surface even when $r_i > r_c$.
This is likely due to more frequent collision event, or collective motions.

  }
  \label{fig:traj-analysis}
\end{figure*}

Next, we measured the position and displacement probability distribution functions (PDF) in the horizontal direction, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(b-d).
The distribution is well fitted by a Gaussian function, shown as the red curve.
According to \citet{Leptos2009}, in the presence of swimmers, the displacement PDF is characterized by a Gaussian core and exponential tails.
In our data, exponential tails are also observed when $\Delta t = 0.02, 0.08, 0.14$ s, manifesting anomalous transport [Fig.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(c)].
Further increasing the time interval makes the exponential tails disappear.
\textcolor{red}{When rescaling the displacement $\Delta y$ with square root of time interval $\Delta t^{1/2}$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(d), we notice that all the Gaussian cores of the PDF curves, except the $\Delta t=0.02, 0.08$ s ones, collapse on the same master curve.
The deviations of the small $\Delta t$ curves from the master curve suggest that strong persistence is in play at this time scale $\tau_c\approx 0.1$ s, rather than a random diffusive process.}
Finally, we measured the mean square displacement (MSD) of inner droplets in all our experiments, at various bacterial concentrations and droplet sizes, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(e).
The lag time and MSD are rescaled by $\tau^*$ and $D_A\tau^*$, respectively, which are obtained from fitting the original MSD data to the 1D model described before.
An example of the fit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:traj-analysis}(f).
Typically, the MSD is characterized by a superdiffusive regime at small $\Delta t$, and a transition to saturation at large $\Delta t$.
A diffusive regime can be identified in some cases, but not always.
The critical $\Delta t$'s, $\tau$ and $\tau^*$, vary with droplet sizes and possibility bacterial concentrations, which will be discussed in the following section.

\subsection{Confinement effect}

We studied the motions of inner droplets in over 100 systems of various sizes and bacterial concentration.
Although the simple ``mechanical mixing'' technique does not provide accurate control over droplet sizes, we manage to explore a considerable large parameter space in detail, and to reveal the confinement effect.
The explored parameter space is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:confinement-effect}(a).
Since we have 3 different parameters varying at the same time, we shall select experiments where two of the parameters are fixed, in order to illustrate the effect from a single parameter.
Here, we choose $\text{OD}\in(20, 40]$ (blue pentagons) and $\text{OD}\in(60, 80]$ (green squares) to illustrate low and high bacterial concentrations, respectively.
To see the effect of outer droplet radius $r_o$, we select data where $r_i\in[5, 9]$ ($\mu$m) and plot active diffusivity $D_A$, persistence time $\tau$ and relaxation time $\tau^*$ as functions of $r_o$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:confinement-effect}(b).
We find that $D_A$ increases monotonically with $r_o$ at both low and high OD.
The increasing rate at high OD, characterized by the slope of $D_A$-$r_o$ curve, is much larger than that at low OD.
$\tau$ and $\tau^*$ show little to no dependence on $r_o$ in our experiments.
Similarly, to see the effect of inner droplet radius $r_i$, we select data where $r_o\in[30, 50]$ ($\mu$m) and plot $D_A$, $\tau$ and $\tau^*$ as functions of $r_i$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:confinement-effect}(c).
We find that neither $D_A$ nor $\tau$ show pronounced dependence on $r_i$, while $\tau^*$ decreases monotonically with $r_i$.
Interestingly, $\tau^*$ at different OD's are quite consistent in magnitude.

% I'm not sure if I should discuss the predictions of the model here, or later in another section.

\begin{figure}[!t]

  }
  \label{fig:confinement-effect}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Bacterial activity}

The confinement effect on the active diffusivity may be correlated with the bacterial activity.
Indeed, we frequently observed very different activity at the same bacterial concentration.
In order to quantify the activity, we perform PIV analysis on the bright field images of active double emulsions and use the root mean square of the PIV velocity magnitude as a measure of activity.
Formally, we obtain velocity magnitude field $\mathbb{V}=\{\bm{V}_{i}\}$ from PIV.
The mean velocity $\overline V$ is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    \overline V = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^N |\bm{V}_{i}|^2}.
\end{equation}
%
To suppress noise from the detection, mean velocities are measured in each pair of frames and then averaged. 
We fix the interrogation window size at 20 pixels throughout all the analyses, with overlap between adjacent windows at 10 pixels.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{bacterial-activity}
  \caption{
  Mean PIV velocity $\overline V$ as a measure of bacterial activity, plotted against outer droplet radius $r_o$.
  }
  \label{fig:bacterial-activity}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:bacterial-activity}, we plot $\overline V$ as a function of $r_o$.
As usual, the data are put into different groups by bacterial concentrations.
In each OD bin, in particular $\text{OD}\in(20, 40]$ (blue pentagons) and $\text{OD}\in(60, 80]$ (green squares), $\overline V$ increases with $r_o$, suggesting that droplet confinement hinders the activity of bacteria.
However, from this data, it is still unclear how activity depends on OD.

\textcolor{red}{
At the moment, we have not finished PIV on all the videos, partially due to the less organized data analysis in the past.
As a result, we see less data points in Fig.~\ref{fig:bacterial-activity} compared to the parameter space plot Fig.~\ref{fig:confinement-effect}(a).
In addition, I did not have Cristian's raw data from Chile, so it was impossible to apply the same PIV algorithm on both data sets.
Recently, we are transferring the raw videos from Chile to Paris.
In the meantime, I am reorganizing and redoing PIV analysis on the Paris data.
The goal of this reanalysis is to provide better consistency in the method.
For example, when setting interrogation window size, we want the physical size (rather than pixel size) to be constant across all the analysis.
There are also changes in my PIV code, related to smoothing, which can also lead to a difference in the final results.
Last thing is the long standing problem regarding droplet boundary and mask, which also requires uniform treatment.
In short, a REDO of PIV is ongoing, and is likely to change the results given in Fig.~\ref{fig:bacterial-activity}.
When we have the new data, we shall discuss the interpretations and the limitations of the method, and so on.
}
\subsection{Droplet lifetime}
\textcolor{blue}{
In this section, we report the time dependence of droplet activity, in particular the ``frozen droplet'' phenomenon.
We hope to use this phenomenon as a support of our argument that confinement affects bacterial activity.
However, even if this support turns out to be weak, we still can publish this phenomenon on its own, because it's new.
}

It is of key importance to ensure steady state in all active matter experiment.
For bacterial systems, this is particularly challenging, due to the fact that bacteria are very sensitive to their environment, which can change rapidly due to the massive metabolic activities. 
Our experiment typically produce 10-minute videos of active double emulsions. 
A typical bacterial sample used in our experiment, however, can only last around an hour, before the activity decay becomes apparent. 
Therefore, it is necessary to verify the steady state of experiment. 

\subsection{Numerical simulation}
% Idea is to align some simulation results with experimental results.
% The current simulation is good on its own, but lacks some alignment with experiment, for example the parameters.
% If there are new results from simulation, we can get together to discuss what to include in this section.
\subsection*{Model and Langevin equation}
% Here I will write the details of the model, and then summarize that in the main text.
\begin{figure}[!t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{DEScheme.png}
  \caption{
  Mean PIV velocity $\overline V$ as a measure of bacterial activity, plotted against outer droplet radius $r_o$.
  }
  \label{fig:DE_scheme}
\end{figure}
 To describe the motion of a particle of density $\rho_i$, radii $r_i$ immersed in a bacterial bath with viscosity $\eta$ and density $\rho_0$ which is confined in a spherical domain of radii $r_o$ and density $\rho_0$, as we shown in the figure (\ref{fig:DE_scheme}).
 We propose a Langevin equation with an active noise produced by the bacterial bath and reflective boundary condition. 
 This noise is modeled as an colored noise with zero mean.
 The boundary condition for the particle can be written as follow: $x^2+y^2+z^2\leq (r_o-r_i)^2$, which mean that in any time $t$ the particle is inside the sphere.  
The equation of motion in the limit of low Reynolds number is the following:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq.Langevin_num}
  \mathbf{\dot{r}}=\mathbf{u}(t)-\tilde{v}\mathbf{\hat{z}}.
\end{align}
where  $\tilde{v}=2\pi r_i^2 \delta\rho/9\eta$ is the sedimentation velocity of the particle.
It can be shown that a Colored noise is produced by a random motion with white noise, eg, an Uhlenbeck-Ornstein process:
\begin{align}
  \dot{u}&=-\frac{u}{\tau}+\frac{\xi(t)}{\tau}\\
\end{align}
Where $\xi(t)$ is a white noise with zero mean and variance delta:
\begin{align}
  \langle \xi(t)\rangle &=0,\\
  \langle \xi(t)\xi(t')\rangle &=2\frac{v^2}{\tau}\delta(t-t').
\end{align}
Using Laplace transform, the solution for $t>0$ is:
\begin{align}
  u(t)=u_0e^{-t/\tau}+\int_0^{t} \dd s \ e^{-(t-t')/\tau}\xi(s).
\end{align}
 The second moment is:
\begin{align}
  \langle u(t)u(t')\rangle &=v^2e^{-|t-t'|/\tau}. 
\end{align}
Which is the velocity autocorrelation function of this velocity field.
To solve this system numerically, we used the Euler-Maruyama method for stochastic differencial equations.
As we mention before, we can produce an exponentially time correlated noise from a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
Using Euler, we solve for the position of the particle and the noise for the time step $n$.
\begin{align}
   \label{eq:Euler_method}
   x_n&=x_{n-1}+u_{x_{n-1}}\dd t,\\
   y_n&=y_{n-1}+u_{y_{n-1}}\dd t,\\
   z_n&=z_{n-1}+u_{z_{n-1}-\tilde{v}}\dd t,\\
   u^i_{n}&=u^i_{n-1}-\frac{1}{\tau}u^i_{n-1}+\frac{1}{\tau}v\sqrt{2\Delta t}N^i_{n}
\end{align}
Where $N^{i}_n$ is a random number with zero mean and variance one. For the spherical confinement we use a reflective boundary condition. 
That is, at each time step the algorithm compute the norm of the position of the particle and checks whether the particle has moved outside the sphere. 
When the particle is outside the sphere a tangent plane is computed in the surface of the sphere in the position where crossed the surface, and then the particle is reflected respect to the tangent plane.

    \section{Algorithm reflective boundary condition}

The reflective boundary condition for the spherical confinement is: if the particle is outside the sphere, that is, $z^2+y^2+x^2>r^2$ reflect that position inside the sphere. 
To do that, after the compute the position of the inner droplet we impose the condition that the norm of the position is less than one, the radius of the outer droplet. 
The procedure is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine if a point is outside of the sphere, that is \\ $||xyz|| = \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2} > 1$.
    \item If there are no points outside of the sphere, then go back to step 1.
    \item For each point outside the sphere, find the intersection of its path with the sphere. For this we consider the equation of the sphere with center in zero, $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.
    \item The vector will have a starting point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and ending point $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$.
    \item The points along the line through these three points will be given in parametric form by:
    \begin{align}
        x(t)&= (x_1-x_0)t+x_0,\\
        y(t)&=(y_1-y_0)t+y_0,\\
        z(t)&=(z_1-z_0)t+z_0.
    \end{align}
    where $t$ is a real number between $0<t<1$. Now if we substitute for $x,y,z$ in the equation of the sphere. The parametrized expression we get a quadratic equation for $t$.
    \item After collecting terms we have:
    \begin{align}
        at^2+bt+c=0,
    \end{align}
    with 
   \begin{align}
       a&=(x_1-x_0)^2+(y_1-y_0)^2+(z_1-z_0)^2,\\
       b&= 2(x_1-x_0)x_0+2(y_1-y_0)y_0+2(z_1-z_0)z_0,\\
       c&= x_0^2+y_0^2+z_0^2.
   \end{align} 
   And the roots for $t$ may be found with the quadratic formula                              $t=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\frac{2c}{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}$. We will use the second form to avoid $a=0$.

   \item Now we have to find the tangent plane of the sphere at the intersection point. For the case of the circle this is easy, because we can draw a line from the center of the circle to the intersection point on the circle. The negative  inverse of the slope of this line is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the intersection point. Combining this with the intersection point we have a line. And then we can reflect the point that its outside across this tangent line. But for 3D the notion of slope its different so I used another approach to find the reflection point across the tangent plane. 
   \item After find the intersection point with $xyz_{inter}= xyz_0 + (xyz_1-xyz_0)t=N(x_2,y_2,z_2)$, we keep the closest to the point outside the sphere. This new point $N(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is the intersection point, and we have the point $P(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ which is outside the sphere.
  \item Find the vector from the intersection point to the new point $\mathbf{v}=xyz-N$ and then find the reflection of the vector $\mathbf{a}$ with respect to the tangent line at the intersection point, that is, $xyz =xyz-\frac{2(N \cdot v)}{||N||^2}N$. 
  
  \item Now we have a particle that moves randomly confined in a sphere.

\section{Droplet tracking}

Although the HT method can roughly detect the locations of the inner droplets, the accuracy was not satisfactory when we just use it as it was. 
There are two major issues: 
(i) No subpixel accuracy: all the detections are separated from each other by integer pixels; (ii) Inconsistent detection: whether the algorithm detects the inner edge or the outer edge of a droplet is not consistent, essentially because it only considers the pixel intensity gradient.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{hc-correction}

  (e) MSD of original trajectory (blue) and improved trajectory (orange).
  }
  \label{fig:hc-correction}
\end{figure}

To resolve these issues, we build a custom correction method to refine the results by HT.
In our images of droplets, we notice that all the droplets have dark edges, which may be a result of strong refraction at the edges. 
If we draw a line from droplet center, in the radial direction, to outside the droplet (yellow lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(a)), the image intensity profile along that line would likely show a valley (a dark peak, indicated as red spots in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(a)). 
This valley turns out to be a more unambiguous indicator of the droplet edge position. 
By drawing multiple lines across the droplet boundary and analyzing each pixel intensity profile to get a valley position, we get the coordinates of multiple points on the
droplet edge, from which we can fit a circle.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(b), the orange circle is a result of the above fitting procedure.
Compare to the original detection of the HT method (blue circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(b)), both the size and the position are more consistent with the image. 
Figure~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(c) shows the trajectories from both methods (red for original HT, yellow for corrected).
Two improvements are immediately noticed: 
(i) the corrected trajectory is generally higher, closer to the actual center of the droplet;
(ii) the ``lattice'' like pattern in the original trajectory is absent in corrected trajectory, suggesting less subpixel bias.
Indeed, the subpixel statistics is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}, and we see considerable improvement on the subpixel bias. 
We compared the MSD of both trajectories, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc-correction}(e).
At short times, the corrected MSD is generally smaller, while at long times, the two MSD are indistinguishable. 
This difference is expected: HT does not detect droplet location accurately. 
At each step, it adds uncertainty to the detected location, making the short time displacement artificially larger.
At long times, however, this artificial displacement becomes less important compared to the actual dispalcement, so that the two MSD converge.
Interestingly, both MSD exhibit subdiffusive regimes at short times, suggesting that even the corrected trajectory is subject to detection noise.
It is challenging to eliminate detection noise by further correction of the trajectories.
Therefore, we acknowledge the presence of this noise and incorporate it in our model to fit experimental MSD.
The results are satisfactory.  

\section{Image analysis}
\label{img.analisis}
Videos are shot between 30-70 fps, with the majority shot at 50 fps for 10 minutes, therefore, to extract the position of the outer and inner droplet we have to analyze about 30000 images. To do that, we made a tracking script in Matlab thats detect both droplets using a Matlab function  called \textit{imfindcircles}. This function finds circles of given radius range and with certain contrast. So we can find dark circles or bright circles of given radii, more parameters can be added to the function, such as sensitivity. The steps to perform the detection of the droplets are summarized in the figure (\ref{Deteccion}). The steps to track the droplets  are: The initial image is cropped  to make detection less resource-intensive, the Matlab \textit{Drawcircle} function is used on this image  to compute the diameter and center of the outer and inner  droplet. From the center and radii of the inner droplet we make a template of the inner droplet with a size of  1.2 times the  inner radii. Now we perform some image adjustments to increase the contrast  and  make the detection easier.  Then using the function \texttt{imfindcircles} for the inner droplet and the outer droplet. For the inner droplet we give to the function a parameter of the radios  $r_{i} \pm$\texttt{delta}, where \texttt{delta} is a constant times the radius detected in the image $k-1$.  We are detecting the inner droplet in the template image, in the step $k$ the template image is compared with the image in the step $k-1$ using the crosscorrelation function \texttt{corr2}.   This function gives a value between $[0-1]$, if this value is $1$ then the image is identical to the image  in the step before. We put the condition if this value is less than 0.5 then increase the value of  \texttt{delta} and so on. The function \texttt{imfindcircles} will detect in a ranges of radius, so in two consecutive image this value of radius can change and therefore change the center of the inner droplet in a small quantity. 

\begin{figure}[b!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{proceso_deteccion.pdf}	
\caption[Detection]{\small{\textbf{Tracking. -} From left to right: The initial image is cropped.  Then draw two circles to calculate the diameters of the drops. An inner droplet template is created with a size of 1.2 times the radii of the inner droplet. Then we detect the outer drop using \textit{imfindcircles} over the cropped image and the same over the template of the inner  droplet.   }}
		\label{Deteccion}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

After detection, on the raw data the data can be smoothed to remove small fluctuations, but the question now arises, how much can we smooth so as not to remove information about the internal droplet motion?.
