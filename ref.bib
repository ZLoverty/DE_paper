Lett. 84, 3017 (2000)] for the diffusive properties of polystyrene beads displaced by bacteria suspended in a two-dimensional fluid film. Our results suggest that superdiffusive behavior should indeed be generically observed in the transition region marking the onset of collective motion.},

  abstract = {Motile Escherichia coli placed at one end of a capillary tube containing an energy source and oxygen migrate out into the tube in one or two bands, which are clearly visible to the naked eye and can also be demonstrated by photography, microscopy, and densitometry and by assaying for bacteria throughout the tube. The formation of two bands is not due to heterogeneity among the bacteria, since the bacteria in each band, when reused, will form two more bands. If an anaerobically utilizable energy source such as galactose is present in excess over the oxygen, the first band consumes all the oxygen and a part of the sugar and the second band uses the residual sugar anaerobically. On the other hand, if oxygen is present in excess over the sugar, the first band oxidizes all the sugar and leaves behind unused oxygen, and the second band uses up the residual oxygen to oxidize an endogenous energy source. The essence of the matter is that the bacteria create a gradient of oxygen or of an energy source, and then they move preferentially in the direction of the higher concentration of the chemical. As a consequence, bands of bacteria (or rings of bacteria in the case of agar plates) form and move out. These results show that E. coli is chemotactic toward oxygen and energy sources such as galactose, glucose, aspartic acid, threonine, or serine. The full repertoire of chemotactic responses by E. coli is no doubt greater than this, and a more complete list remains to be compiled. The studies reported here demonstrate that chemotaxis allows bacteria to find that environment which provides them with the greatest supply of energy. It is clearly an advantage for bacteria to be able to carry out chemotaxis, since by this means they can avoid unfavorable conditions and seek optimum surroundings. Finally, it is necessary to acknowledge the pioneering work of Englemann, Pfeffer, and the other late-19thcentury biologists who discovered chemotaxis in bacteria, and to point out that the studies reported here fully confirm the earlier reports of Beijerinck (4) and Sherris and his collaborators (5,6) on a band of bacteria chemotactic toward oxygen. By using a chemically defined medium instead of a complex broth, it has been possible to study this band more closely and to demonstrate in addition the occurrence of a second band of bacteria chemotactic toward an energy source. Beijerinck (4) did, in fact, sometimes observe a second band, but he did not offer an explanation for it.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.},

The algorithm makes use of the contiguous (connected) set of edge segments produced by our parameter-free edge segment detector, the Edge Drawing Parameter Free (EDPF) algorithm; hence the name EDCircles. The proposed algorithm first computes the edge segments in a given image using EDPF, which are then converted into line segments. The detected line segments are converted into circular arcs, which are joined together using two heuristic algorithms to detect candidate circles and near-circular ellipses. The candidates are finally validated by an a contrario validation step due to the Helmholtz principle, which eliminates false detections leaving only valid circles and near-circular ellipses. We show through experimentation that EDCircles works real-time (10\textendash 20ms for 640\texttimes 480 images), has high detection rates, produces accurate results, and is very suitable for the next generation real-time vision applications including automatic inspection of manufactured products, eye pupil detection, circular traffic sign detection, etc.},

Transcription from the flhB operon and synthesis of flagellin protein similarly peaked in late exponential and early post-exponential phases, respectively. The increase in swimming speed between early-exponential and post-exponential phases was correlated with twofold increases in both flagellar length and flagellar density per cell volume. This increased investment in flagella probably reflects the increased adaptive value of motility in less favorable environments. The decrease in speed between post-exponential and stationary phases was correlated with a threefold decrease in torque produced by the flagellar motors and presumably reflects decreased proton motive force available to stationary-phase cells.},

Recently, microorganisms have been shown to passively exploit and alter these deposition dynamics to increase their survival chances under harshening conditions. Here, we show that, as the droplet evaporation rate slows down, bacterial mobility starts playing a major role in determining the growth dynamics of the edge of drying droplets. Such motility-induced dynamics can influence several biophysical phenomena, from the formation of biofilms to the spreading of pathogens in humid environments and on surfaces subject to periodic drying. Analogous dynamics in other active matter systems can be exploited for technological applications in printing, coating, and self-assembly, where the standard coffee-ring effect is often a nuisance.},

We have found that, in PMMA/acetone droplet placed on a substrate, the liquid below the skin layer is pushed out as the solvent evaporates further. These phenomena indicate that the pressure in the solution increases by solvent evaporation.

Large ensembles of those entities display a large variety of self-organized, collective phenomena, including the formation of moving polar clusters, polar and nematic dynamic bands, mobility-induced phase separation, topological defects, and mesoscale turbulence, among others. Here, we give a brief survey of experimental observations and review the theoretical description of self-propelled rods. Our focus is on the emergent pattern formation of ensembles of dry self-propelled rods governed by short-ranged, contact mediated interactions and their wet counterparts that are also subject to long-ranged hydrodynamic flows. Altogether, self-propelled rods provide an overarching theme covering many aspects of active matter containing well-explored limiting cases. Their collective behavior not only bridges the well-studied regimes of polar selfpropelled particles and active nematics, and includes active phase separation, but also reveals a rich variety of new patterns.},

These phenomena include active turbulence, where suspensions of pusher bacteria at sufficient densities exhibit large-scale, chaotic flows. To study this collective phenomenon, we use large-scale (up to               N               = 3 \texttimes{} 10               6               ) particle-resolved lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by extended stresslets. Such system sizes enable us to obtain quantitative information about both the transition to active turbulence and characteristic features of the turbulent state itself. In the dilute limit, we test analytical predictions for a number of static and dynamic properties against our simulation results. For higher swimmer densities, where swimmer-swimmer interactions become significant, we numerically show that the length- and timescales of the turbulent flows increase steeply near the predicted finite-system transition density.},

Dense populations of such ``active particles'' or ``swimmers'' exhibit a rich collective behavior at large scales. Starting with a minimal physical model of a stroke-averaged swimmer in a fluid, we derive a continuum description of a suspension of active organisms that incorporates fluid-mediated, long-range hydrodynamic interactions among the swimmers. Our work demonstrates that hydrodynamic interactions provide a simple, generic origin for several nonequilibrium phenomena predicted or observed in the literature. The continuum model derived here does not depend on the microscopic physical model of the individual swimmer. The details of the large-scale physics do, however, differ for ``shakers'' (particles that are active but not self-propelled, such as melanocytes) and ``movers'' (self-propelled particles), ``pushers'' (most bacteria) and ``pullers'' (algae like Chlamydomonas). Our work provides a classification of the large-scale behavior of all these systems.},

Such quorum sensing is important for the communication and organisation within bacterial populations. In contrast to living systems, where quorum sensing is determined by biochemical processes, the behaviour of synthetic active particles can be controlled by external fields. Accordingly they allow to investigate how variations of a density-dependent particle response affect their self-organisation. Here we experimentally and numerically demonstrate this concept using a suspension of light-activated active particles whose motility is individually controlled by an external feedback-loop, realised by a particle detection algorithm and a scanning laser system. Depending on how the particles' motility varies with the density of neighbours, the system self-organises into aggregates with different size, density and shape. Since the individual particles' response to their environment is almost freely programmable, this allows for detailed insights on how communication between motile particles affects their collective properties.},

Previous studies suggest that such collective states are related to a critical point, which could explain their balance between robustness to noise and high responsiveness regarding external perturbations. Here we provide experimental evidence for this idea by investigating the stability of swirls formed by light-responsive active colloids which adjust their individual motion to positions and orientations of neighbours. Because their behaviour can be precisely tuned, controlled changes between different collective states can be achieved. During the transition between stable swirls and swarms we observe a maximum of the group's susceptibility indicating the vicinity of a critical point. Our results support the idea of system-independent organisation principles of collective states and provide useful strategies for the realisation of responsive yet stable ensembles in microrobotic systems.},

  abstract = {Bacterial suspensions show turbulence-like spatiotemporal dynamics and vortices moving irregularly inside the suspensions. Understanding these ordered vortices is an ongoing challenge in active matter physics, and their application to the control of autonomous material transport will provide significant development in microfluidics. Despite the extensive studies, one of the key aspects of bacterial propulsion has remained elusive: The motion of bacteria is chiral, i.e., it breaks mirror symmetry. Therefore, the mechanism of control of macroscopic active turbulence by microscopic chirality is still poorly understood. Here, we report the selective stabilization of chiral rotational direction of bacterial vortices in achiral circular microwells sealed by an oil/water interface. The intrinsic chirality of bacterial swimming near the top and bottom interfaces generates chiral collective motions of bacteria at the lateral boundary of the microwell that are opposite in directions. These edge currents grow stronger as bacterial density increases, and, within different top and bottom interfaces, their competition leads to a global rotation of the bacterial suspension in a favored direction, breaking the mirror symmetry of the system. We further demonstrate that chiral edge current favors corotational configurations of interacting vortices, enhancing their ordering. The intrinsic chirality of bacteria is a key feature of the pairing order transition from active turbulence, and the geometric rule of pairing order transition may shed light on the strategy for designing chiral active matter.},

Leptospira, a slender helical bacterium, swims more rapidly in such an environment than it does in water3, even at viscosities of several hundred centipoise (1 cP = 10-3 kg m-1 s-1). This behaviour is baffling until one realises that solutions of viscous agents are highly structured (gel-like). The solute forms a loose quasi-rigid network easily penetrated by particles of microscopic size. The network can exert forces normal to a segment of the body of a slender cell even when that segment does not possess a component of velocity in the normal direction; hydrodynamic treatments of the motion of microorganisms (or of cilia and flagella) do not apply. Solutions containing highly branched polymers, for example, Ficoll, are much more homogeneous. Here, we will review existing evidence for the gel-like character of viscous agents and describe experiments in which the motion of Leptospira or Escherichia coli are compared in solutions of methylcellulose and Ficoll of the same apparent viscosity. Our data show that solutions of methylcellulose are gel-like even when quite dilute, when the bulk viscosity is as small as 2 cP.},

  abstract = {Understanding how bacteria move in porous media is critical to applications in healthcare, agriculture, environmental remediation, and chemical sensing. Recent work has demonstrated that E. coli, which moves by run-and-tumble dynamics in a homogeneous medium, exhibits a new form of motility when confined in a disordered porous medium: hopping-and-trapping motility, in which cells perform rapid, directed hops punctuated by intervals of slow, undirected trapping. Here, we use direct visualization to shed light on how these processes depend on pore-scale confinement and cellular activity. We find that hopping is determined by pore-scale confinement, and is independent of cellular activity; by contrast, trapping is determined by the competition between pore-scale confinement and cellular activity, as predicted by an entropic trapping model. These results thus help to elucidate the factors that regulate bacterial motion in porous media, and could help aid the development of new models of motility in heterogeneous environments.},

However, how pore-scale confinement alters bacterial motility is unknown due to the opacity of typical 3D media. As a result, models of migration are limited and often employ ad hoc assumptions. Here we reveal that the paradigm of run-and-tumble motility is dramatically altered in a porous medium. By directly visualizing individual Escherichia coli, we find that the cells are intermittently and transiently trapped as they navigate the pore space, exhibiting diffusive behavior at long time scales. The trapping durations and the lengths of ``hops'' between traps are broadly distributed, reminiscent of transport in diverse other disordered systems; nevertheless, we show that these quantities can together predict the long-time bacterial translational diffusivity. Our work thus provides a revised picture of bacterial motility in complex media and yields principles for predicting cellular migration.},

The subsequent surface confined motility is found to be very sensitive to the physico-chemical properties of the interfaces which determine the boundary conditions for the flow. The quantitative understanding of this complex dynamics requires detailed and systematic experimental data to validate theoretical models for both flagellar propulsion and interfacial dynamics. Using a combination of optical trapping and holographic imaging we study the 3D dynamics of wall entrapment of swimming bacteria that are sequentially released towards a surfactant-covered liquid\textendash air interface. We find that an incompressible surfactant model for the interface quantitatively accounts for the observed normal and tangential speed of bacteria as they approach the boundary. Surprisingly we also find that, although bacteria circulate over the air phase in counterclockwise circular trajectories, typical of free-slip interfaces, the body axis is still tilted ``nose down'' as found for no-slip interfaces.},

These viscoelastic fluids have been previously shown to affect the swimming kinematics of these microorganisms in non-trivial ways depending on the rheology of the fluid, the particular swimming gait and the structural properties of the immersed body. In this report we put forth a previously unmentioned mechanism by which swimming organisms can experience a speed increase in a viscoelastic fluid. Using numerical simulations and asymptotic theory we find that significant swirling flow around a microscopic swimmer couples with the elasticity of the fluid to generate a marked increase in the swimming speed. We show that the speed enhancement is related to the introduction of mixed flow behind the swimmer and the presence of hoop stresses along its body. Furthermore, this effect persists when varying the fluid rheology and when considering different swimming gaits. This, combined with the generality of the phenomenon (i.e. the coupling of vortical flow with fluid elasticity near a microscopic swimmer), leads us to believe that this method of speed enhancement could be present for a wide range of microorganisms moving through complex fluids.},

The influence of the wall on the near and far fields is discussed.

  abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, occurring from astrophysical to biophysical scales. At the same time, it is widely recognized as one of the key unsolved problems in modern physics, representing a paradigmatic example of nonlinear dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Whereas in the past, most theoretical work in this area has been devoted to Navier\textendash Stokes flows, there is now a growing awareness of the need to extend the research focus to systems with more general patterns of energy injection and dissipation. These include various types of complex fluids and plasmas, as well as active systems consisting of self-propelled particles, like dense bacterial suspensions. Recently, a continuum model has been proposed for such ``living fluids'' that is based on the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, but extends them to include some of the most general terms admitted by the symmetry of the problem [Wensink HH, et al. (2012)               Proc Natl Acad Sci USA               109:14308\textendash 14313]. This introduces a cubic nonlinearity, related to the Toner\textendash Tu theory of flocking, which can interact with the quadratic Navier\textendash Stokes nonlinearity. We show that as a result of the subtle interaction between these two terms, the energy spectra at large spatial scales exhibit power laws that are not universal, but depend on both finite-size effects and physical parameters. Our combined numerical and analytical analysis reveals the origin of this effect and even provides a way to understand it quantitatively. Turbulence in active fluids, characterized by this kind of nonlinear self-organization, defines a new class of turbulent flows.},

The long-range spatial order arises from interactions between two multicellular aggregate structures: a 'swarm ring' that expands radially, and focal aggregates that have lower mobility. Patterning occurs through alternating domination by these two sources of excreted attractant (which we identify here as aspartate). The pattern geometries vary in a systematic way, depending on how long an aggregate remains active; this depends, in turn, on the initial concentration of substrate (here, succinate).},

The comparison between the two approaches displays a fairly good agreement and in particular, we show that the Fokker\textendash Planck approach can predict the structure of the system both in the wall region and in the bulk-like region where the surface forces are negligible. The simultaneous presence of thermal noise and active forces determines the formation of a layer, extending from the walls towards the bulk, where the system exhibits polar order. We relate the presence of such ordering to the mechanical pressure exerted on the container's walls and show how it depends on the separation of the boundaries and determines a Casimir-like attractive force mediated by the active suspension.},

We assume pair-wise repulsive forces among particles, modelling the steric interactions among microswimmers. This system has been experimentally studied in the case of a dilute suspension of Janus particles confined through acoustic traps. We observe that already in the dilute regime - when inter-particle interactions are negligible - increasing the persistent time, {$\tau$}, pushes the particles away from the potential minimum, until a saturation distance is reached. We compute the phase diagram (activity versus interaction length), showing that the interaction does not suppress this delocalization phenomenon but induces a liquid- or solid-like structure in the densest regions. Interestingly a reentrant behavior is observed: a first increase of {$\tau$} from small values acts as an effective warming, favouring fluidization; at higher values, when the delocalization occurs, a further increase of {$\tau$} induces freezing inside the densest regions. An approximate analytical scheme gives fair predictions for the density profiles in the weakly interacting case. The analysis of non-equilibrium heat fluxes reveals that in the region of largest particle concentration equilibrium is restored in several aspects.},

In the case of two-dimensional chiral particles confined by harmonic walls, we determine the analytic form of the distribution of positions and velocities in two different situations: a rotationally invariant confining potential and an infinite channel with parabolic walls. Both these models display currents and chirality induced inner accumulation. These phenomena are further investigated by means of a more realistic description of a channel, where the wall and bulk regions are clearly separated. The corresponding current and density profiles are obtained by numerical simulations. At variance with the harmonic models, the third model shows a progressive emptying of the wall regions and the simultaneous enhancement of the bulk population. We explain such a phenomenon in terms of the combined effect of wall repulsive forces and chiral motion and provide a semiquantitative description of the current profile in terms of effective viscosity of the chiral gas.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been discovered that systems of active Brownian particles (APB) at high density organise their velocities into coherent domains showing large spatial structures in the velocity field. This collective behavior occurs spontaneously, i.e. is not caused by any specific interparticle force favoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in the absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces could be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis that velocity alignment is a robust property of ABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal fluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the P\'eclet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled particles, is not sufficient to fully characterize this phenomenon either in the regimes of large viscosity or small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity domains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity correlation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases and decreases as the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that, contrary to the common belief, the spatial velocity correlation not only depends on inertia but is also non-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We conclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems, variations in the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as independent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of the spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent and active temperatures.},

  abstract = {We investigate a two-dimensional system of active particles confined to a narrow annular domain. Despite the absence of explicit interactions among the velocities or the active forces of different particles, the system displays a transition from a disordered and stuck state to an ordered state of global collective motion where the particles rotate persistently clockwise or anticlockwise. We describe this behavior by introducing a suitable order parameter, the velocity polarization, measuring the global alignment of the particles' velocities along the tangential direction of the ring. We also measure the spatial velocity correlation function and its correlation length to characterize the two states. In the rotating phase, the velocity correlation displays an algebraic decay that is analytically predicted together with its correlation length, while in the stuck regime, the velocity correlation decays exponentially with a correlation length that increases with the persistence time. In the first case, the correlation (and, in particular, its correlation length) does not depend on the active force but the system size only. The global collective motion, an effect caused by the interplay between finite-size, periodicity, and persistent active forces, disappears as the size of the ring becomes infinite, suggesting that this phenomenon does not correspond to a phase transition in the usual thermodynamic sense.},

Among these, a significant class execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight path for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating the process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is diffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically, motility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local environment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady state is reached, this is not generally invariant under time reversal: the principle of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal symmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile bacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy that drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller. Here I review some statistical\textendash mechanical models for bacterial motility, presenting them as a paradigm for exploring diffusion without detailed balance. I also discuss the extent to which statistical physics is useful in understanding real or potential microbiological experiments.},

These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motilityinduced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variablespeed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

To model this, we take an overdamped harmonically trapped particle subjected to a thermal and a non-equilibrium noise arising from the active bath. The harmonic well can be attributed to a laser trap or to the small amplitude motion of the sedimented colloid at the bottom of the capillary. In the long time, the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state that can be described by an effective temperature. By adopting this notion of effective temperature, we investigate whether fluctuation relations for entropy hold. In addition, when subjected to a deterministic time dependent drag, we find that transient fluctuation theorem for work cannot be applied in conventional form. However, a steady state fluctuation relation for work emerges out with a renormalized temperature.},

Linear stability analysis shows that for small \$R\$ disturbances grow at a rate linear in their wavenumber \$q\$, and that the dominant instability mode involves twist.

We present numerical evidence in three and two dimensions that this inertia driven flocking transition is continuous, with a correlation length that grows on approaching the transition.

Inter- and intra-cellular and macromolecular interactions in the drying plasma or blood drop are responsible for the final morphologies of the dried patterns. Changes in these cellular and macromolecular components in blood caused by diseases have been suspected to cause changes in the dried drop patterns of plasma and whole blood, which could be used as simple diagnostic tools to identify the health of humans and livestock. However, complex physicochemical driving forces involved in the pattern formation are not fully understood. This review focuses on the scientific development in microscopic observations and pattern interpretation of dried plasma and whole blood samples, as well as the diagnostic applications of pattern analysis. Dried drop patterns of plasma consist of intricate visible cracks in the outer region and fine structures in the central region, which are mainly influenced by the presence and concentration of inorganic salts and proteins during drying. The shrinkage of macromolecular gel and its adhesion to the substrate surface have been thought to be responsible for the formation of the cracks. Dried drop patterns of whole blood have three characteristic zones; their formation as functions of drying time has been reported in the literature. Some research works have applied engineering treatment to the evaporation process of whole blood samples. The sensitivities of the resultant patterns to the relative humidity of the environment, the wettability of the substrates, and the size of the drop have been reported. These research works shed light on the mechanisms of spreading, evaporation, gelation, and crack formation of the blood drops on solid substrates, as well as on the potential applications of dried drop patterns of plasma and whole blood in diagnosis.},

As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper-flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. Less studied, however, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and their counterpart planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in circular microwells allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. On a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain Enterobacter sp. SM3 in swarming and planktonic states exhibited different motion patterns when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 mm and 90 mm, swarming SM3 formed a single-swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 formed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across several other species of gramnegative bacteria. We also observed `rafting behavior' of swarming bacteria upon dilution. We hypothesize that the rafting behavior might account for the motion pattern difference. We were able to predict these experimental features via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with stronger cell\textendash cell alignment interaction. Our experimental design using PDMS microchip disk arrays enabled us to observe bacterial swarming on murine intestinal surface, suggesting a new method for characterizing bacterial swarming under complex environments, such as in polymicrobial niches, and for in vivo swarming exploration.},

Our experimental results find that the active noise experienced by the granular rotor does show an exponential time correlation to a good extent, even though due to the small experimental system and low collision frequency, the profile of the active noise in our system is non-Gaussian.

  abstract = {Swimming microorganisms have been previously observed to accumulate along walls in confined systems both experimentally and in computer simulations. Here, we use computer simulations of dilute populations for a simplified model of an organism to calculate the dynamics of swimmers between two walls with an external fluid flow. Simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are used to quantify their influence on surface accumulation. We found that the accumulation of organisms at the wall is larger when HIs are included. An external fluid flow orients the organisms parallel to the fluid flow, which reduces the accumulation at the walls. The effect of the flow on the orientations is quantified and compared to previous work on upstream swimming of organisms and alignment of passive rods in flow. In pressure-driven flow, the zero shear rate at the channel center leads to a dip in the concentration of organisms in the center. The curvature of this dip is quantified as a function of the flow rate. The fluid flow also affects the transport of organisms across the channel from one wall to the other.},

  abstract = {Unlike equilibrium statistical mechanics, with its well-established foundations, a similar widely-accepted framework for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (NESM) remains elusive. Here, we review some of the many recent activities on NESM, focusing on some of the fundamental issues and general aspects. Using the language of stochastic Markov processes, we emphasize general properties of the evolution of configurational probabilities, as described by master equations. Of particular interest are systems in which the dynamics violate detailed balance, since such systems serve to model a wide variety of phenomena in nature. We next review two distinct approaches for investigating such problems. One approach focuses on models sufficiently simple to allow us to find exact, analytic, non-trivial results. We provide detailed mathematical analyses of a onedimensional continuous-time lattice gas, the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP). It is regarded as a paradigmatic model for NESM, much like the role the Ising model played for equilibrium statistical mechanics. It is also the starting point for the second approach, which attempts to include more realistic ingredients in order to be more applicable to systems in nature. Restricting ourselves to the area of biophysics and cellular biology, we review a number of models that are relevant for transport phenomena. Successes and limitations of these simple models are also highlighted.},

We show how various components, and modifications of two recent scalar, structural kinetic, thixotropic models, can offer several modeling and prediction improvements, and compare our results to the Maxwell-like Bautista-Manero-Puig (BMP) model, and a recent transient model based on the Herschel-Bulkley. We explore the weakness of the legacy blood models, and then, we apply this newly improved model to recently published data from the literature in order to demonstrate its efficacy in modeling steady state, transient, and oscillatory shear flow. Following this effort, we demonstrate a novel approach using the sequence of physical phenomena (SPP) to facilitate interpretation, characterization, mapping, and ``fingerprinting'' of transient blood data from the literature. We compare the SPP approach to other LAOS analysis techniques in the literature and show how our approach can function as a mechanical-property diagnostic blood analysis tool. The goal of this work is a deeper understanding of the microstructural basis and validity of structural thixotropic blood models, and transient flow analysis techniques and procedures.},

  abstract = {We consider a Brownian particle which, in addition to being in contact with a thermal bath, is driven by fluctuating forces which stem from active processes in the system, such as self-propulsion or collisions with other active particles. These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation relation and therefore play the role of a nonequilibrium environment, which keeps the system permanently out of thermal equilibrium even in the absence of external forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium character of the active matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the trajectories of the Brownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log ratio of path probabilities for observing a certain particle trajectory forward in time versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory. For passive Brownian motion, it is well known that this path probability ratio quantifies irreversibility in terms of entropy production. For active Brownian motion, we show that in addition to the usual entropy produced in the thermal environment, the path probability ratio contains a contribution to irreversibility from mutual information ``production'' between the particle trajectory and the history of the nonequilibrium environment. The resulting irreversibility measure fulfills an integral fluctuation theorem and a second-law-like relation. When deriving and discussing these relations, we keep in mind that the active fluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active particles pushing around a passive colloid or due to active self-propulsion of the particle itself; we point out the similarities and differences between these two situations. We obtain explicit expressions for active fluctuations modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we illustrate our general results by analyzing a Brownian particle which is trapped in a static or moving harmonic potential.},

We examined the motion of swarming Escherichia coli, comparing the motion of individual cells to their motion during swimming. Swarming cells' speeds are comparable to bulk swimming speeds, but very broadly distributed. Their speeds and orientations are correlated over a short distance (several cell lengths), but this correlation is not isotropic. We observe the swirling that is conspicuous in many swarming systems, probably due to increasingly long-lived correlations among cells that associate into groups. The normal run-tumble behavior seen in swimming chemotaxis is largely suppressed, instead, cells are continually reoriented by random jostling by their neighbors, randomizing their directions in a few tenths of a second. At the edge of the swarm, cells often pause, then swim back toward the center of the swarm or along its edge. Local alignment among cells, a necessary condition of many flocking theories, is accomplished by cell body collisions and/or shortrange hydrodynamic interactions.},

The coupling between BZ droplets is dominated by inhibition and is strongest at low concentrations of malonic acid (MA) and small droplet separations. A microfluidic chip is used for mixing the BZ reactants, forming monodisperse droplets by flow-focusing and directing them into a hydrophobized 100 \textmu m diameter capillary. For samples composed of many drops and in the absence of well defined initial conditions, the anti-phase attractor, in which adjacent droplets oscillate 180\textdegree{} out-of-phase, is observed for strong coupling. When the coupling strength is reduced the initial transients in the phase difference between neighboring droplets persist until the BZ reactants are exhausted. In order to make quantitative comparison with theory, we use photosensitive Ru(bipy)32+-catalyzed BZ droplets and set both boundary and initial conditions of arrays of small numbers of oscillating BZ droplets with a programmable illumination source. In these small collections of droplets, transient patterns decay rapidly and we observe several more complex attractors, including ones in which some adjacent droplets are in-phase. Excellent agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is achieved.},

Here, we demonstrate how a multistable metamaterial can harness topological solitons with coupled rotational and translational components and become, itself, a crawling robot. We start by characterizing the topological solitons via experimental measurements and analysis. We then use their rotational component to produce a favorable gradient of friction between the metamaterial and the underlying substrate. This, in turn, creates locomotion. Previously proposed crawling robots usually require complex control of multiple actuators. In contrast, our robot can be powered by a single actuator, and all features needed for locomotion are embedded in the mechanics and activated by the topological solitons.},

  abstract = {Understanding flow and transport of bacteria in porous media is crucial to technologies such as bioremediation, biomineralization or enhanced oil recovery. While physicochemical bacteria filtration is well-documented, recent studies showed that bacterial motility plays a key role in the transport process. Flow and transport experiments performed in microfluidic chips containing randomly placed obstacles confirmed that the distributions of non-motile particles stays compact, whereas for the motile strains, the distributions are characterized by both significant retention as well as fast downstream motion. For motile bacteria, the detailed microscopic study of individual bacteria trajectories reveals two salient features: (i) the emergence of an active retention process triggered by motility, (ii) enhancement of dispersion due to the exchange between fast flow channels and low flow regions in the vicinity of the solid grains. We propose a physical model based on a continuous time random walk approach. This approach accounts for bacteria dispersion via variable pore-scale flow velocities through a Markov model for equidistant particle speeds. Motility of bacteria is modeled by a two-rate trapping process that accounts for the motion towards and active trapping at the obstacles. This approach captures the forward tails observed for the distribution of bacteria displacements, and quantifies an enhanced hydrodynamic dispersion effect that originates in the interaction between flow at the pore-scale and bacterial motility. The model reproduces the experimental observations, and predicts bacteria dispersion and transport at the macroscale.},

  abstract = {Bacterial motion is strongly affected by the presence of a surface. One of the hallmarks of swimming near a surface is a defined curvature of bacterial trajectories, underlining the importance of counter rotations of the cell body and flagellum for locomotion of the microorganism. We find that there is another mode of bacterial motion on solid surfaces, i.e., self trapping due to fluid flows created by a rotating flagellum perpendicular to the surface. For a rod-like bacterium, such as Escherichia coli, this creates a peculiar situation in that the bacterium appears to swim along a minor axis of the cell body and is pressed against the surface. Although a full hydrodynamic theory is still lacking to explain the self-trapping phenomenon, the effect is intriguing and can be exploited to study a variety of biophysical phenomena of swimming bacteria. In particular, we showed that self-trapped E.~coli cells display a chemotaxis response that is identical to the classical rotation assay in which antibodies are used to physically "glue" a flagellum to the surface.},

This chapter provides an overview of the issues that arise with the use of computational algorithms in live cell imaging studies, with particular emphasis on the close coordination of sample preparation, image acquisition, and computational image analysis. It also aims to introduce the terminology and central concepts of computer vision to facilitate the communication between cell biologists and computer scientists in collaborative imaging projects.},

The viscoelastic nonlinearity of the three nanofluids groups was studied by Lissajous curves, local nonlinear viscoelastic moduli of an oscillatory shear cycle, and Fourier transform rheology as a function of filler concentration and increasing and decreasing strain magnitude. The nonlinear behavior of the nanofluids was compared to understand the variation of internal microstructures. Firstly, GO/PDMS composites behave with higher moduli and smaller linear viscoelastic range comparing to that of other two composites. Secondly, the elastic stress Lissajous curves of these composites changed from elliptic to rectangular with round the corner with increasing the filler level and strain amplitude. Thirdly, all these three nanofluids exhibited intra-cycle strain stiffening with increasing strains and shear thickening at intermediate strain and then shearing thinning with increasing strain further. Fourthly, higher harmonic intensity of rGO/PDMS increased with increasing strain and came to a plateau, while that of other two nanofluids reached a maximum and then decreased. It suggested that different surface functionalization of nanoparticles will present different rheological behavior due to formed different network and LAOS could be used as a potential helpful method to characterize rheological properties of nanocomposites, especially at higher shear strain.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms have evolved to thrive in virtually any terrestrial and marine environment, exposing them to various mechanical cues mainly generated by fluid flow and pressure as well as surface contact. Cellular components enable bacteria to sense and respond to physical cues to optimize their function, ultimately improving bacterial fitness. Owing to newly developed biophysical techniques, we are now starting to appreciate the breadth of bacterial phenotypes influenced by mechanical inputs: adhesion, motility{$\mkern1mu$}, biofilm formation and pathogenicity. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss how microbiology and biophysics are converging to advance our understanding of the mechanobiology of microorganisms. We first review the various physical forces that bacteria experience in their natural environments and describe the structures that transmit these forces to a cell. We then discuss how forces can provide feedback to enhance adhesion and motility and how they can be transduced by dedicated cellular machinery to regulate diverse phenotypes. Finally{$\mkern1mu$}, we provide a perspective on how mechanics influence biofilm spatial organization and homeostasis.},

Here, we study both analytically and numerically the scattering of a tracer particle in different types of time-dependent, hydrodynamic flow fields. Specifically, we compare the tracer motion induced by an externally driven colloid with the one generated by various self-motile, multi-sphere swimmers. Our results suggest that force-free swimmers generically induce loop-shaped tracer trajectories. The specific topological structure of these loops is determined by the hydrodynamic properties of the microswimmer. Quantitative estimates for typical experimental conditions imply that the loops survive on average even if Brownian motion effects are taken into account.},

Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift\textendash Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner\textendash Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitative description of dense bacterial suspensions. We discuss how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces, and conclude by outlining future applications.},

Our focus will be mostly on surface tension effects, which result from the cohesive properties of liquids. Paradoxically, cohesive forces promote the breakup of jets, widely encountered in nature, technology and basic science, for example in nuclear fission, DNA sampling, medical diagnostics, sprays, agricultural irrigation and jet engine technology. Liquid jets thus serve as a paradigm for free-surface motion, hydrodynamic instability and singularity formation leading to drop breakup. In addition to their practical usefulness, jets are an ideal probe for liquid properties, such as surface tension, viscosity or non-Newtonian rheology. They also arise from the last but one topology change of liquid masses bursting into sprays. Jet dynamics are sensitive to the turbulent or thermal excitation of the fluid, as well as to the surrounding gas or fluid medium. The aim of this review is to provide a unified description of the fundamental and the technological aspects of these subjects.},

  abstract = {Locomotion and transport of microorganisms in fluids is an essential aspect of life. Search for food, orientation toward light, spreading of off-spring, and the formation of colonies are only possible due to locomotion. Swimming at the microscale occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where fluid friction and viscosity dominates over inertia. Here, evolution achieved propulsion mechanisms, which overcome and even exploit drag. Prominent propulsion mechanisms are rotating helical flagella, exploited by many bacteria, and snake-like or whip-like motion of eukaryotic flagella, utilized by sperm and algae. For artificial microswimmers, alternative concepts to convert chemical energy or heat into directed motion can be employed, which are potentially more efficient. The dynamics of microswimmers comprises many facets, which are all required to achieve locomotion. In this article, we review the physics of locomotion of biological and synthetic microswimmers, and the collective behavior of their assemblies. Starting from individual microswimmers, we describe the various propulsion mechanism of biological and synthetic systems and address the hydrodynamic aspects of swimming. This comprises synchronization and the concerted beating of flagella and cilia. In addition, the swimming behavior next to surfaces is examined. Finally, collective and cooperate phenomena of various types of isotropic and anisotropic swimmers with and without hydrodynamic interactions are discussed.},

  abstract = {When confined to curved surfaces or to bounded volumes, ordered materials often experience geometric frustration, where the order cannot be satisfied everywhere on the surface or in the volume. This frustration induces unavoidable distortions in the material, possibly resulting in the generation of one or more defects in the order. In this thesis, we focus on materials with nematic order and investigate the role of geometry in the interplay between order and confinement. We first consider a nematic confined to the surface of a toroidal droplet. The nematic is active such that the individual particles do work on their surroundings. This activity results in a nematic that spontaneously undergoes creation and annihilation of opposite-signed pairs of topological defects; these defects continually move and explore the surface of the torus. Despite the activity, we find that the defects couple to the underlying curvature of the surface: on average, the positive defects migrate towards the outside of the torus, where the Gaussian curvature is positive, and the negative defects migrate towards the inside of the torus, where Gaussian curvature is negative. When we compare our results to equilibrium predictions as well as to computer simulations of our active nematic, we find that adding activity to order resembles bringing an equilibrium system to high temperature; that is, activity plays the role of thermal fluctuations in driving the defects to explore configuration space. There are, however, significant differences with equilibrium nematics that bring richness to the problem. We next consider a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) confined to toroidal droplets with homeotropic anchoring. We find a twisted equilibrium configuration, where the nematic spontaneously develops chirality and the amount of twist depends on the ratio of the torus ring and tube radii. Experiments with a NLC confined to straight and bent cylindrical capillaries under similar conditions reveal that the twist is a response to the additional curvature that arises when bending a cylinder into a torus. Lastly, we consider a NLC confined to a capillary bridge under homeotropic anchoring such that the topology requires the presence of a defect in the bulk. We perform experiments with waist-shaped and barrel-shaped bridges and find that waist-shaped bridges contain hyperbolic defects while barrel-shaped bridges contain radial defects. In addition, we find that the ratio of the bridge height to its width determines whether the defect is a ring defect or a point defect. Overall, our results illustrate the variety of ways curvature affects nematic order: it can control defect type, defect location, and can even tune specific distortions in the order.},

  abstract = {The exact solution for a small falling drop is a classical result by Hadamard and Rybczynski. But experiments show that small drops fall slower than predicted, giving closer agreement with Stokes' result for a falling hard sphere. Increasing the drop size, a transition between these two extremes is found. This is due to surfactants present in the system, and previous work has led to the stagnant-cap model. We present here an alternative approach which we call the continuous-interface model. In contrast to the stagnant-cap model, we do not consider a surfactant advection\textendash diffusionequation at the interface. Taking instead the normal and tangential interfacial stresses into account, we solve the Stokes equation analytically for the falling drop with varying interfacial tension. Some of the solutions thus obtained, e.g. the hovering drop, violate conservation of energy unless energy is provided directly to the interface. Considering the energy budget of the drop, we show that the terminal velocity is bounded by the Stokes and the Hadamard\textendash Rybczynski results. The continuous-interface model is then obtained from the force balance for surfactants at the interface. The resulting expressions gives the transition between the two extremes, and also predicts that the critical radius, below which drops fall like hard spheres, is proportional to the interfacial surfactant concentration. By analysing experimental results from the literature, we confirm this prediction, thus providing strong arguments for the validity of the proposed model.},

We studied two model biofluids, blood plasma and synovial fluid, when deposited onto slightly hydrophilic substrates forming a contact angle of 50\textendash 90\textdegree. Drops were imaged during the evaporation process and geometric properties of the drop, such as contact angle and drop height, were calculated from the images. The resulting dried biofluid drops were then examined using light microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to assess morphological and chemical composition of the dried drop. The effect of substrate contact angle (surface wetting) and fluid concentration was examined. We found that when biofluids are deposited onto slightly hydrophilic surfaces, with a contact angle of 50\textendash 90\textdegree, a ring-shaped deposit was formed. Analysis of the drying drop's geometric properties indicates that biofluid dynamics follow the piling model of drop formation, as proposed by Deegan               et al.               The final deposition pattern varied with substrate surface and concentration, as shown by light microscopy photos of dried drops. The chemical composition of the outer ring was minimally affected by substrate surface, but the spatial heterogeneity of protein distribution within the ring varied with concentration. These results indicate that biofluid drop deposition produces ring-shaped deposits which can be examined by multiple analytical techniques.},

  abstract = {Confined suspensions of active particles show peculiar dynamics characterized by wall accumulation, as well as upstream swimming, centreline depletion and shear trapping when a pressure-driven flow is imposed. We use theory and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of confinement and non-uniform shear on the dynamics of a dilute suspension of Brownian active swimmers by incorporating a detailed treatment of boundary conditions within a simple kinetic model where the configuration of the suspension is described using a conservation equation for the probability distribution function of particle positions and orientations, and where particle\textendash particle and particle\textendash wall hydrodynamic interactions are neglected. Based on this model, we first investigate the effects of confinement in the absence of flow, in which case the dynamics is governed by a swimming P\'eclet number, or ratio of the persistence length of particle trajectories over the channel width, and a second swimmer-specific parameter whose inverse measures the strength of propulsion. In the limit of weak and strong propulsion, asymptotic expressions for the full distribution function are derived. For finite propulsion, analytical expressions for the concentration and polarization profiles are also obtained using a truncated moment expansion of the distribution function. In agreement with experimental observations, the existence of a concentration/polarization boundary layer in wide channels is reported and characterized, suggesting that wall accumulation in active suspensions is primarily a kinematic effect that does not require hydrodynamic interactions. Next, we show that application of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow leads to net upstream swimming of the particles relative to the flow, and an analytical expression for the mean upstream velocity is derived in the weak-flow limit. In stronger imposed flows, we also predict the formation of a depletion layer near the channel centreline, due to cross-streamline migration of the swimming particles towards high-shear regions where they become trapped, and an asymptotic analysis in the strong-flow limit is used to obtain a scale for the depletion layer thickness and to rationalize the non-monotonic dependence of the intensity of depletion upon flow rate. Our theoretical predictions are all shown to be in excellent agreement with finite-volume numerical simulations of the kinetic model, and are also supported by recent experiments on bacterial suspensions in microfluidic devices.},

We first show that active particles moving on a surface with no ability to probe its curvature only exhibit steady-state inhomogeneities in the presence of orientational order. We then consider a strongly confined 3D ideal active gas and compute its steady-state density distribution in a box of arbitrary convex shape.},

  abstract = {Active systems evade the rules of equilibrium thermodynamics by constantly dissipating energy at the level of their microscopic components. This energy flux stems from the conversion of a fuel, present in the environment, into sustained individual motion. It can lead to collective effects without any equilibrium equivalent, such as a phase separation for purely repulsive particles, or a collective motion (flocking) for aligning particles. Some of these effects can be rationalized by using equilibrium tools to recapitulate nonequilibrium transitions. An important challenge is then to delineate systematically to which extent the character of these active transitions is genuinely distinct from equilibrium analogs. We review recent works that use stochastic thermodynamics tools to identify, for active systems, a measure of irreversibility comprising a coarse-grained or informatic entropy production. We describe how this relates to the underlying energy dissipation or thermodynamic entropy production, and how it is influenced by collective behavior. Then, we review the possibility to construct thermodynamic ensembles out-of-equilibrium, where trajectories are biased towards atypical values of nonequilibrium observables. We show that this is a generic route to discovering unexpected phase transitions in active matter systems, which can also inform their design.},

Furthermore, about 500 new records are reported from hundreds of samples collected world-wide, and four new species are described from Kenyan soils, including the new genus Apobryophyllum; Metopus ovalis Kahl, 1927 is redescribed. 643 ciliate species were originally described or reliably recorded from about 1000 soil samples world-wide, 49 (7.6\%) of them were later recognized as junior synonyms, and 78 (13.2\%) have been poorly described, leaving a total of 516 wellknown species. However, the studied samples contained about 700 new species, most of which (about 500) have not yet been described. Thus, the total number of soil ciliates amounts to at least 1000 species. The overwhelming portion of soil ciliates belongs to three systematic assemblages, viz. the hypotrichs (39\%), gymnostomatids (26\%) and colpodids (13\%) if the undescribed species are taken into account. Most soil ciliates feed on bacteria (39\%) or are predatory (34\%) or omnivorous (20\%). Some are strictly mycophagous and highly characteristic for terrestrial habitats; and a few (mainly metopids) are anaerobic. Only about one fourth of the soil ciliate species has been reliably reported from freshwater habitats and from more than three out of five main biogeographical regions, indicating a high specificity of the soil ciliate biota and a limited distribution of at least some species. This is supported by the observation that some very conspicuous species, such as Krassniggia auxiliaris and Bresslauides discoideus, have so far been found only in Gondwanan, respectively, Laurasian soils.},

Here, we introduce and explore an analytically tractable nonlinear model for compressible active flow networks. In contrast to thermally driven systems, we find that active friction selects discrete states with a limited number of oscillation modes activated at distinct fixed amplitudes. Using perturbation theory, we systematically predict the stationary states of noisy networks and find good agreement with a Bayesian state estimation based on a hidden Markov model applied to simulated time series data. Our results suggest that the macroscopic response of active network structures, from actomyosin force networks to cytoplasmic flows, can be dominated by a significantly reduced number of modes, in contrast to energy equipartition in thermal equilibrium. The model is also well suited to study topological sound modes and spectral band gaps in active matter.},

Moreover cell motility is also intrinsically noisy due to spontaneous random reorientations and speed fluctuations. This interplay of internal and external noise sources gives rise to a complex dynamical behavior that can be strongly sensitive to details and hard to model quantitatively. In striking contrast to this general picture we show that the mean residence time of swimming bacteria inside artificial complex microstructures is quantitatively predicted by a generic invariance property of random walks. We find that while external shape and internal disorder have dramatic effects on the distributions of path lengths and residence times, the corresponding mean values are constrained by the sole free surface to perimeter ratio. As a counterintuitive consequence, bacteria escape faster from structures with higher density of obstacles due to the lower accessible surface.},

Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1\textendash 6, non-equilibrium systems7\textendash 9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13\textendash 15 and metamaterials16\textendash 20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16\textendash 20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle.},

In contrast, under conditions of oxygen shortage the correlation length saturates at a value of around 7 body lengths.},

Using a coarse-grained active liquid crystal model, we designed and investigated a single self-driven droplet which encapsulated a dense suspension comprising nonmotile but mobile active particles that generate extensile stresses. We showed that such droplets can be driven into motion and can have tunable mobilities owing to their internal collective motion, which is characterized by induced active flows and motile disclination defects. Furthermore, it was illustrated that the interplay among the internal directional flows, liquid crystalline structures, droplet size, and surface tension resulted in different types of locomotion and rotation.},

  abstract = {The drying of complex fluids involves a large number of microscopic phenomena (transport and organization of non-volatile solutes) as well as hydrodynamic and mechanical instabilities. These phenomena can be captured in drying sessile drops where different domains can be identified: strong concentration gradients, formation of a glassy or porous envelope that withstands mechanical stress, and consolidation of a layer strongly adhering to the substrate at the drop edge. In colloidal systems, we quantify the evolution of the particle volume fraction at a nanometric scale and microscopic scale and identify the conditions for the envelope formation at the free surface by balancing the effect of diffusion and evaporation. When a solid envelope is formed at a drop surface, the mechanical instabilities induced by the drying result in different drop shapes. Finally, large drying stresses build up in the solid layer adhering on the substrate, and possibly cause crack formation. In particular, we study how crack patterns are affected by the contact angle of drops and the drying conditions. A particular interest of the review is devoted to drying pattern of solutes.},

Specifically, we simulate light-controlled surface-driven active matter, probing the emergent properties of a suspension of active colloids that can bind and unbind from surfaces of a closed microchamber, together creating an active carpet. The attached colloids generate large-scale flows that in turn can advect detached particles toward the walls. Switching the particle velocities with light, we program the active suspension and demonstrate a rich design space of flow patterns characterized by topological defects. We derive the possible mode structures and use this theory to optimize different microfluidic functions including hydrodynamic compartmentalization and chaotic mixing. Our results pave the way toward designing and controlling surface-driven active fluids.},

  abstract = {In many situations, bacteria move in complex environments, as soils, oceans or the human gut-track, where carrier fluids show complex structures associated with non-Newtonian rheology. Many fundamental questions concerning the ability to navigate in such environments remain unsolved. Recently, it has been shown that the kinetics of bacterial motion in structured fluids as liquid crystals (LCs) is constrained by the orientational molecular order (or director field) and that novel spatio-temporal patterns arise. A question unaddressed so far is how bacteria change swimming direction in such an environment. In this work, we study the swimming mechanism of a single bacterium, Esherichia coli, constrained to move along the director field of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal confined to a planar cell. Here, the spontaneous `run and tumble' motion of the bacterium gets frustrated: the elasticity of the LC prevents flagella from unbundling. Interestingly, to change direction, bacteria execute a reversal motion along the director field, driven by the relocation of a single flagellum, a `frustrated tumble'. We characterize this phenomenon in detail experimentally, exploiting exceptional spatial and temporal resolution of bacterial and flagellar dynamics, using a two colour Lagrangian tracking technique. We suggest a possible mechanism accounting for these observations.},

In contrast to previous studies, we find that the damping and noise correlations possess long-time tails with exponents that depend on the tracer symmetry. For generic tracers, shape asymmetry induces ratchet effects that alter fluctuations and lead to superdiffusion and friction that grows with time when the tracer is dragged at a constant speed. In the singular limit of a completely symmetric tracer, we recover normal diffusion and finite friction. Furthermore, for small symmetric tracers, the active contribution to the friction becomes negative: active particles enhance motion rather than oppose it. These results show that, in low-dimensional systems, the motion of a passive tracer in an active bath cannot be modeled as a persistent random walker with a finite correlation time.},

Instead of increasing the viscosity of the suspending fluid, the emergent collective motions of swimming bacteria can turn a suspension into a superfluid with zero apparent viscosity. Although the existence of active superfluids has been demonstrated in bulk rheological measurements, the microscopic origin and dynamics of such an exotic phase have not been experimentally probed. Here, using high-speed confocal rheometry, we study the dynamics of concentrated bacterial suspensions under simple planar shear. We find that bacterial superfluids under shear exhibit unusual symmetric shear bands, defying the conventional wisdom on shear banding of complex fluids, where the formation of steady shear bands necessarily breaks the symmetry of unsheared samples. We propose a simple hydrodynamic model based on the local stress balance and the ergodic sampling of nonequilibrium shear configurations, which quantitatively describes the observed symmetric shear-banding structure. The model also successfully predicts various interesting features of swarming vortices in stationary bacterial suspensions. Our study provides insights into the physical properties of collective swarming in active fluids and illustrates their profound influences on transport processes.},

  abstract = {Depending on the exact experimental conditions, the thermodynamic properties of physical systems can be related to one or more thermostatistical ensembles. Here, we survey the notion of thermodynamic temperature in different statistical ensembles, focusing in particular on subtleties that arise when ensembles become non-equivalent. The `mother' of all ensembles, the microcanonical ensemble, uses entropy and internal energy (the most fundamental, dynamically conserved quantity) to derive temperature as a secondary thermodynamic variable. Over the past century, some confusion has been caused by the fact that several competing microcanonical entropy definitions are used in the literature, most commonly the volume and surface entropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be proved, however, that only the volume entropy satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of thermodynamics for a broad class of physical systems, including all standard classical Hamiltonian systems, regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous fact implies that negative `absolute' temperatures and Carnot efficiencies more than 1 are not achievable within a standard thermodynamical framework. As an important offspring of microcanonical thermostatistics, we shall briefly consider the canonical ensemble and comment on the validity of the Boltzmann weight factor. We conclude by addressing open mathematical problems that arise for systems with discrete energy spectra.},

The average distance between defects, also called active length scale, depends on the competition between these forces. Here, in experiments with the microtubule/kinesin active nematic system, we show that the intrinsic active length scale loses its relevance under strong lateral confinement. Transitions are observed from chaotic to vortex lattices and defect-free unidirectional flows. Defects, which determine the active flow behaviour, are created and annihilated on the channel walls rather than in the bulk, and acquire a strong orientational order in narrow channels. Their nucleation is governed by an instability whose wavelength is effectively screened by the channel width. These results are recovered in simulations, and the comparison highlights the role of boundary conditions.},

Controlling the flow patterns of active nematics remains a limiting step towards their use as functional materials. Here we show that confining a tubulin\textendash kinesin active nematic to a network of connected annular microfluidic channels enables controlled directional flows and autonomous transport. In single annular channels, for narrow widths, the typically chaotic streams transform into well-defined circulating flows, whose direction or handedness can be controlled by introducing asymmetric corrugations on the channel walls. The dynamics is altered when two or three annular channels are interconnected. These more complex topologies lead to scenarios of synchronization, anti-correlation, and frustration of the active flows, and to the stabilisation of high topological singularities in both the flow field and the orientational field of the material. Controlling textures and flows in these microfluidic platforms opens unexplored perspectives towards their application in biotechnology and materials science.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the role of the topology of the environment on the formation of complex nematic fields and defect structures, specifically in the system of nematic colloidal knots. The topological environments around knotted colloidal particles are suggested to exist as spherical surface-patterned nematic cavities imposing radial, uniform or hyperbolic nematic profiles. We show that topologically different nematic environments significantly affect and create differences in the colloidal field structure created within the environment, such as the location, profile and number of topological defects. Specifically, we demonstrate that topological environments in combination with knotted colloidal particles of non-trivial topology lead to the formation of diverse nematic knotted and linked fields. These fields are different adaptations of the knotted shape of the colloidal particles, creating knots and links of topological defects as well as escaped-core defect-like solitonic structures. These are observed in chiral nematic media but here are stabilised in achiral nematic media as a result of the distinct shape of the knotted colloidal particle, with a double helix segment and nematic environmental patterns. More generally, this paper is a contribution towards understanding the role of environment, especially its topology, on the response and defect formation in elastic fields, such as in nematic liquid crystal colloids.},

Collective length-scale selection has been observed in bacterial fluids, endothelial tissue, and active colloids, yet the physical origins of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we systematically derive an effective fourth-order field theory from a generic microscopic model that allows us to predict the typical vortex size in microswimmer suspensions. Building on a self-consistent closure condition, the derivation shows that the vortex length scale is determined by the competition between local alignment forces, rotational diffusion, and intermediate-range hydrodynamic interactions. Vortex structures found in simulations of the theory agree with recent measurements in Bacillus subtilis suspensions. Moreover, our approach yields an effective viscosity enhancement (reduction), as reported experimentally for puller (pusher) microorganisms.},

Bacteria, which can be found in a variety of environments, have developed among the richest set of locomotion mechanisms both at the microscopic and collective levels. Here, we uncover, experimentally, a mode of collective bacterial motility in humid environment through the depinning of bacterial droplets. Although capillary forces are notoriously enormous at the bacterial scale, even capable of pinning water droplets of millimetric size on inclined surfaces, we show that bacteria are able to harness a variety of mechanisms to unpin contact lines, hence inducing a collective slipping of the colony across the surface. Contrary to flagella-dependent migration modes like swarming, we show that this much faster ``colony surfing'' still occurs in mutant strains of               Bacillus subtilis               lacking flagella. The active unpinning seen in our experiments relies on a variety of microscopic mechanisms, which could each play an important role in the migration of microorganisms in humid environment.},

The results of simulations are compared with a theory that describes dilute suspensions of swimmers. The theory yields scalings with concentration for diffusivities and velocity fluctuations as well as a prediction of the fluid velocity spatial autocorrelation function. Even for uncorrelated swimmers, the theory predicts anticorrelations between nearby fluid elements that correspond to vortex-like swirling motions in the fluid with length scale set by the size of a swimmer and the slit height. Very similar results arise from the full simulations indicating either that correlated motion of the swimmers is not significant at the concentrations considered or that the fluid phase autocorrelation is not a sensitive measure of the correlated motion. This result is in stark contrast with results from unconfined systems, for which the fluid autocorrelation captures large-scale collective fluid structures. The additional length scale (screening length) introduced by the confinement seems to prevent these large-scale structures from forming.},

Understanding environmental factors affecting the attachment and the early stages of the biofilm development as well as the development of active methods of biofilm control are crucial for many applications. Here we show that biofilm formation is strongly affected by the hydrodynamics of flows generated by surface waves in layers of bacterial suspensions. Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned biofilms while wave-driven turbulent motion destroys the patterns. The location of the attached bacteria on a solid substrate differs from the settlement location of inactive bacteria and of the passive micro-particles: strong biofilms form under the wave antinodes while passive particles and inactive bacteria settle under nodal points. By controlling the wave lengths and horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can either shape the biofilm formation and enhance the biofilm growth, or discourage the formation of biofilm patterns. The results suggest that the deterministic wave-driven transport, rather than hydrodynamic forces, determine the preferred location for the bacterial attachment.},

In this study, we propose that an active droplet is driven by a collective motion of enclosed microswimmers. We show that the droplet migrates via the flow field generated by the enclosed microswimmers; moreover, the locomotion direction depends on the swimming mode of these internal particles. The locomotion mechanism of the droplet can be well explained by interfacial velocity, and the locomotion velocity shows good agreement with the Lighthill-Blake theory. These findings are essential to understand the interplay between the motion of self-propelled particles and the bulk motion response of active matter.},

  abstract = {Biological processes, from morphogenesis to tumor invasion, spontaneously generate shear stresses inside living tissue. The mechanisms that govern the transmission of mechanical forces in epithelia and the collective response of the tissue to bulk shear deformations remain, however, poorly understood. Using a minimal cell-based computational model, we investigate the constitutive relation of confluent tissues under simple shear deformation. We show that an initially undeformed fluidlike tissue acquires finite rigidity above a critical applied strain. This is akin to the shear-driven rigidity observed in other soft matter systems. Interestingly, shear-driven rigidity can be understood by a critical scaling analysis in the vicinity of the second order critical point that governs the liquid-solid transition of the undeformed system. We further show that a solidlike tissue responds linearly only to small strains and but then switches to a nonlinear response at larger stains, with substantial stiffening. Finally, we propose a mean-field formulation for cells under shear that offers a simple physical explanation of shear-driven rigidity and nonlinear response in a tissue.},

The high-quality DNS data in the inertial subrange and the dissipative range enable the examination of detailed statistics at small scales, such as the normalized energy-dissipation rate, energy and energy-flux spectra, the intermittency of the velocity gradients and increments, scaling exponents, and flow-field structure.

  abstract = {The rheological properties of a cell suspension may play an important role in the flow field generated by populations of swimming micro-organisms (e.g. in bioconvection). In this paper, a swimming micro-organism is modelled as a squirming sphere with prescribed tangential surface velocity, in which the centre of mass of the sphere may be displaced from the geometric centre (               bottom-heaviness               ). Effects of inertia and Brownian motion are neglected, because real micro-organisms swim at very low Reynolds numbers but are too large for Brownian effects to be important. The three-dimensional movement of 64 identical squirmers in a simple shear flow field, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions, is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations. The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that has been constructed by the boundary element method. The restriction to pairwise additivity of forces is expected to be justified if the suspension is semi-dilute. The results for non-bottom-heavy squirmers show that the squirming does not have a direct influence on the apparent viscosity. However, it does change the probability density in configuration space, and thereby causes a slight decrease in the apparent viscosity at               O               (               c               2               ), where               c               is the volume fraction of spheres. In the case of bottom-heavy squirmers, on the other hand, the stresslet generated by the squirming motion directly contributes to the bulk stress at               O               (               c               ), and the suspension shows strong non-Newtonian properties. When the background simple shear flow is directed vertically, the apparent viscosity of the semi-dilute suspension of bottom-heavy squirmers becomes smaller than that of inert spheres. When the shear flow is horizontal and varies with the vertical coordinate, on the other hand, the apparent viscosity becomes larger than that of inert spheres. In addition, significant normal stress differences appear for all relative orientations of gravity and the shear flow, in the case of bottom-heavy squirmers.},

  abstract = {We characterize the motility of athermal swimming droplets within the framework of a persistent random walk. Just like active colloids, their trajectories can be modeled with a constant velocity V and a slow angular diffusion, but the random changes in direction are not thermally driven. Instead, V is determined by the interfacial tension gradient along the droplet surface, while reorientation of the surfactant gradient leads to changes in direction with a persistence time {$\tau$}. We show that the origin of locomotion is the difference in the critical micellar concentration in the front and the back of the droplet, {$\Delta$}CMC. Tuning this parameter by salt controls V from 3 to 15 diameters d/s. Surfactant concentration has little effect on speed, but leads to a dramatic decrease in {$\tau$} over 4 orders of magnitude. The corresponding range of the persistence length {$\mathscr{l}$}=V{$\tau$} extends beyond the realm of synthetic or living swimmers, in which V is limited by fuel consumption and {$\tau$} is set by thermal fluctuations or biological activity, respectively. Our tunable swimmers are ideal candidates for the study of the departure from equilibrium to high levels of activity. We show that their collective behavior exhibits the formation of active clusters of a well-defined size.},

One feasible theoretical explanation of a circular crack is the Xia-Hutchinson model, in which a preexisting track (flaw loop) in the film is necessary for initiating and propagating the crack on the circular path. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of dried deposition to support this model. Our results indicate that cracks along the circular trajectory can surprisingly ``pass'' across a 180 {$\mu$}m air gap. Moreover, two arc-path cracks originate in different areas and propagate to meet, forming a circular trajectory. These unexpected crack initiation and propagation indicate that the crack propagates alone the ``preformed'' track, experimentally confirming the hypothesis proposed by the Xia-Hutchinson model. The transition of the circular crack to a radial one indicates that the deposition microstructure is the dominant factor for the crack formation.},

  abstract = {The natural habitats of microorganisms in the human microbiome, ocean and soil ecosystems are full of colloids and macromolecules. Such environments exhibit non-Newtonian flow properties, drastically affecting the locomotion of microorganisms1\textendash 5. Although the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of swimming flagellated bacteria in simple Newtonian fluids has been well developed6\textendash 9, our understanding of bacterial motility in complex non-Newtonian fluids is less mature10,11. Even after six decades of research, fundamental questions about the nature and origin of bacterial motility enhancement in polymer solutions are still under debate12\textendash 23. Here we show that flagellated bacteria in dilute colloidal suspensions display quantitatively similar motile behaviours to those in dilute polymer solutions, in particular a universal particle-size-dependent motility enhancement up to 80\% accompanied by a strong suppression of bacterial wobbling18,24. By virtue of the hard-sphere nature of colloids, whose size and volume fraction we vary across experiments, our results shed light on the long-standing controversy over bacterial motility enhancement in complex fluids and suggest that polymer dynamics may not be essential for capturing the phenomenon12\textendash 23. A physical model that incorporates the colloidal nature of complex fluids quantitatively explains bacterial wobbling dynamics and mobility enhancement in both colloidal and polymeric fluids. Our findings contribute to the understanding of motile behaviours of bacteria in complex fluids, which are relevant for a wide range of microbiological processes25 and for engineering bacterial swimming in complex environments26,27.},

This hydrodynamic phenomenon is dominant below a critical shear rate and robust against Brownian motion and cell tumbling. We deduce that individual bacteria entering a flow system can rapidly migrate upstream ({$>$}20 mm/s) much faster than a gradually advancing biofilm. Given a bacterial population with a distribution of sizes and swim speeds, local shear rate near the surface determines the dominant hydrodynamic mode for motility, i.e., circular or random trajectories for low shear rates, positive rheotaxis for moderate flow, and sideways swimming at higher shear rates. Faster swimmers can move upstream more rapidly and at higher shear rates, as expected. Interestingly, we also find on average that both swim speed and upstream motility are independent of cell aspect ratio.},

For all persistence values, the active fluid undergoes a nonequilibrium glass transition at large density. This is accompanied by collective motion, whose nature evolves from near-equilibrium spatially heterogeneous dynamics at small persistence, to a qualitatively different intermittent dynamics when persistence is large. This latter regime involves a complex time evolution of the correlated displacement field.},

Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we measure the distributions and auto-correlation functions of force and torque exerted by active particles on the tracer. The tracer experiences a finite average force along its polar axis, while all the correlation functions show exponential decay in time. Using these insights we construct the full coarse-grained Langevin description for tracer position and orientation, where the active particles are subsumed into an effective self-propulsion force and exponentially correlated noise for both translations and rotations. The ensuing mesoscopic dynamics can be described in terms of five dimensionless parameters. We perform a thorough parameter study of the mean squared displacement, which illustrates how the different parameters influence the tracer dynamics, which crosses over from a ballistic to diffusive motion. We also demonstrate that the distribution of tracer displacements evolves from a non-Gaussian shape at early stages to a Gaussian behavior for sufficiently long times. Finally, for a given set of microscopic parameters, we establish a procedure to estimate the matching parameters of our effective model, and show that the resulting dynamics is in a very good quantitative agreement with the one obtained in Brownian dynamics simulations.},

We reveal that a quasi two-dimensional fluid droplet enclosing motile colloids powered by the Quincke effect (Quincke rollers) exhibits strong shape fluctuations with a power spectrum consistent with active fluctuations driven by particle-interface collisions. A broken detailed balance confirms the nonequilibrium nature of the shape dynamics. We further find that rollers self-organize into a single drop-spanning vortex, which can undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking and vortex splitting. The droplet acquires motility while the vortex doublet exists. Our findings provide insights into the complex collective behavior of active colloidal suspensions in soft confinement.},

Analytical expressions for the Green function are obtained that are used to compute the flow of monopole or dipole swimmers at various alignments of the swimmers with respect to the homogeneous director field. Flow profile is also solved for the flow sources/sinks and source dipoles showing clear emergence of anisotropy in the magnitude of flow profile as the result of fluid anisotropic viscosity. The range of validity of the presented analytical solutions is explored, as compared to exact numerical solutions of the Stokes equation.

Using nematoelastic interactions, we show how four-nbit configurations can realize universal classical NOR and NAND gates.

The observed collective dynamics has been interpreted as the onset of a hydrodynamic instability, of the quiescent isotropic state of pushers, swimmers with extensile force dipoles, above a critical threshold proportional to the swimmer concentration. In this work, we develop a particle-based model to simulate a suspension of hydrodynamically interacting rod-like swimmers to estimate this threshold. Unlike earlier simulations, the velocity disturbance field due to each swimmer is specified in terms of the intrinsic swimmer stress alone, as per viscous slender-body theory. This allows for a computationally efficient kinematic simulation where the interaction law between swimmers is known               a priori               . The neglect of induced stresses is of secondary importance since the aforementioned instability arises solely due to the intrinsic swimmer force dipoles.                                         Our kinematic simulations include, for the first time, intrinsic decorrelation mechanisms found in bacteria, such as tumbling and rotary diffusion. To begin with, we simulate so-called straight swimmers that lack intrinsic orientation decorrelation mechanisms, and a comparison with earlier results serves as a proof of principle. Next, we simulate suspensions of swimmers that tumble and undergo rotary diffusion, as a function of the swimmer number density                                                                      \$(n)\$                                               , and the intrinsic decorrelation time (the average duration between tumbles,                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash it\textbackslash tau\}\$                                               , for tumblers, and the inverse of the rotary diffusivity,                                                                      \$D\_\{r\}\^\{-1\}\$                                               , for rotary diffusers). The simulations, as a function of the decorrelation time, are carried out with hydrodynamic interactions (between swimmers) turned off and on, and for both pushers and pullers (swimmers with contractile force dipoles). The `interactions-off' simulations allow for a validation based on analytical expressions for the tracer diffusivity in the stable regime, and reveal a non-trivial box size dependence that arises with varying strength of the hydrodynamic interactions. The `interactions-on' simulations lead us to our main finding: the existence of a box-size-independent parameter that characterizes the onset of instability in a pusher suspension, and is given by                                                                      \$nUL\^\{2\}\{\textbackslash it\textbackslash tau\}\$                                               for tumblers and                                                                      \$nUL\^\{2\}/D\_\{r\}\$                                               for rotary diffusers; here,                                                                      \$U\$                                               and                                                                      \$L\$                                               are the swimming speed and swimmer length, respectively.

Nontrivial rheology can couple to porous microstructure leading to surprising flow patterns and associated transport properties in geophysical, biological, and industrial systems. Viscoelastic instabilities are highly sensitive to pore geometry and can give rise to chaotic velocity fluctuations. A number of recent studies have begun to untangle how the pore-scale geometry influences the sample-scale flow topology and the resulting dispersive transport properties of these complex systems. Beyond classical rheological properties, active colloids and swimming cells exhibit a range of unique properties, including reduced effective viscosity, collective motion, and random walks, that present novel challenges to understanding their mechanics and transport in porous media flows. This review article aims to provide a brief overview of essential, fundamental concepts followed by an in-depth summary of recent developments in this rapidly evolving field. The chosen topics are motivated by applications, and new opportunities for discovery are highlighted.},

We perform Brownian dynamics simulations of active stiff polymers undergoing run-reverse dynamics, and so mimic bacterial swimming, in porous media. In accord with experiments of Escherichia coli, the polymer dynamics are characterized by trapping phases interrupted by directed hopping motion through the pores. Our findings show that the spreading of active agents in porous media can be optimized by tuning their run lengths, which we rationalize using a coarse-grained model. More significantly, we discover a geometric criterion for the optimal spreading, which emerges when their run lengths are comparable to the longest straight path available in the porous medium. Our criterion unifies results for porous media with disparate pore sizes and shapes and for run-and-tumble polymers. It thus provides a fundamental principle for optimal transport of active agents in densely-packed biological and environmental settings.},

Based on our experiments, we build a minimal model that quantitatively predicts the geometry of the scattering trajectories, and enhanced colloidal diffusion at long times. This quantitative confrontation between theory and experiments elucidates the microscopic origin of enhanced transport. Collisions are solely ruled by stochastic contact interactions responsible both for genuine anomalous diffusion at short times and enhanced diffusion at long times with no ballistic regime at any scale.},

We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

A comprehensive study was made of the residue patterns of Al2O3 and TiO2 aqueous nanofluid droplets on different substrates (i.e. glass, stainless steel and Teflon). It was found that a ring-shaped pattern was formed at low concentrations and small particle sizes, while a uniform pattern was formed at high concentrations and large particle sizes for Al2O3 nanofluids. In addition, only ring-shaped residue patterns were observed for all concentrations of TiO2 nanofluids. In the case of different substrates, on a material with a high contact angle with water, it was difficult to form a ring-shaped pattern. The widths of the ring-shaped pattern were analyzed as well. The results showed that the width of the ring-shaped pattern was larger for small particles. The materials of substrate and nanoparticle also influenced the width.},

We use particle image velocimetry to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, we find that the vortex areas comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed, which allows us to extract the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale on the ATP concentration, which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude of the active stress. Our data suggest a possible mapping between the ATP concentration and the active stress that is based on the Michaelis\textendash Menten kinetics that governs the motion of individual kinesin motors.},

We first investigate the relevance of effective temperatures in the dilute and moderately dense fluids. We find that a unique effective temperature does not in general characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics of the active fluid over this broad range of densities, because fluctuation-dissipation relations yield a lengthscale-dependent effective temperature. By contrast, we find that the approach to a non-equilibrium glass transition at very large densities is accompanied by the emergence of a unique effective temperature shared by fluctuations at all lengthscales. This suggests that an effective thermal dynamics generically emerges at long times in very dense suspensions of active particles due to the collective freezing occurring at non-equilibrium glass transitions.},

Here we show that even the simplest mixture of (velocity-aligning) circle swimmers with two different frequencies, hosts a complex world of superstructures: The most remarkable example comprises a microflock pattern, formed in one species, while the other species phase separates and forms a macrocluster, coexisting with a gas phase. Here, one species microphase-separates and selects a characteristic length scale, whereas the other one macrophase separates and selects a density. A second notable example, here occurring in an isotropic system, are patterns comprising two different characteristic length scales, which are controllable via frequency and swimming speed of the individual particles.},

In many examples, such as bacterial systems and biofilament assays, constituent units are elongated and can give rise to local nematic orientational order. Such ``active nematics'' systems have attracted much attention from both theorists and experimentalists. However, despite intense research efforts, data-driven quantitative modeling has not been achieved, a situation mainly due to the lack of systematic experimental data and to the large number of parameters of current models. Here, we introduce an active nematics system made of swarming filamentous bacteria. We simultaneously measure orientation and velocity fields and show that the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be quantitatively reproduced by a type of microscopic model for active suspensions whose important parameters are all estimated from comprehensive experimental data. This provides unprecedented access to key effective parameters and mechanisms governing active nematics. Our approach is applicable to different types of dense suspensions and shows a path toward more quantitative active matter research.},

A, vol. 374, 2010, p. 3487), where fluid particle displacements due to inviscid swimmers are added to produce an effective diffusivity. Here we show that, for the viscous case, the swimmers cannot be assumed to swim an infinite distance, even though their total mass displacement is finite. Instead, the largest contributions to particle displacement, and hence to mixing, arise from random changes of direction of swimming and are dominated by the far-field stresslet term in our simple model. We validate the results by numerical simulation. We also calculate non-zero Reynolds number corrections to the effective diffusivity. Finally, we show that displacements due to randomly swimming squirmers exhibit probability distribution functions with exponential tails and a short-time superdiffusive regime, as found previously by several authors. In our case, the exponential tails are due to `sticking' near the stagnation points on the squirmer's surface.},

The infinite series solution is especially suitable for computation purposes being an exponentially decreasing series. From the series the "far field" behaviour is extracted. It is found that a force singularity parallel to the two planes has a far field behaviour of source and image for the parallel components (a two dimensional source doublet of height-dependent strength) whereas the normal component, and all fields due to a force singularity normal to the planes, die out exponentially. Velocity fields are compared with those of the one plane case. An estimate of the influence of the second wall and when its effect can be disregarded is obtained.},

Our simulations demonstrate that the nanoparticle organization in the systems undergo reversible transition between random state and long-ranged intercalation state, controlled by various structural parameters of the tethered chains and the applied pressure. The dynamical mechanism during the transition is explored through examining the diffusion trajectories of the nanoparticles confined at the interfaces. We provide a theoretical analysis of the lateral pressure induced by the tethered chains, which is fully supported by simulation data and reveals that the compressioninduced transition is fundamentally attributed to the entropic effect from the tethered chains.

The experimental results indicate that the crack number or crack spacing presents a general dependence on the substrate roughness, despite the orientation of the substrate textures. Interestingly, the crack spacing decreases with the increase of the roughness. Two possible mechanisms are proposed to understand the dependence of the cracks on roughness. Firstly, the concentration reduction of the drying suspension due to collecting colloidal particles from the substrate textures decreases the crack spacing. Secondly, stress concentration resulting from the defects (the notches in textures) in the dried deposition enhances crack formation. However, a quantitative estimation by the calculation of the stress concentrating factors reveals that the notch of the substrate textures dominates crack variation. The results here bring forth a practical method for controlling the crack orientation and suppression, and a potential application to crack-free coatings, films and paintings during the drying of complex fluids.},

Here, we combine experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the dynamical regimes and morphological transitions of elastic Brownian filaments in a simple shear flow. Actin filaments are used as an experimental model system and their conformations are investigated through fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic channels. Simulations matching the experimental conditions are also performed using inextensible Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam theory and nonlocal slender-body hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations and agree quantitatively with observations. We demonstrate that filament dynamics in this system are primarily governed by a dimensionless elasto-viscous number comparing viscous drag forces to elastic bending forces, with thermal fluctuations playing only a secondary role. While short and rigid filaments perform quasi-periodic tumbling motions, a buckling instability arises above a critical flow strength. A second transition to strongly deformed shapes occurs at a yet larger value of the elasto-viscous number and is characterized by the appearance of localized high-curvature bends that propagate along the filaments in apparent ``snaking'' motions. A theoretical model for the as yet unexplored onset of snaking accurately predicts the transition and explains the observed dynamics. We present a complete characterization of filament morphologies and transitions as a function of elasto-viscous number and scaled persistence length and demonstrate excellent agreement between theory, experiments, and simulations.},

Our study reveals a strong confinement effect: the viscosity of bacterial suspensions decreases substantially when the confinement scale is comparable or smaller than the run length of bacteria. Moreover, we also investigate the microscopic dynamics of bacterial suspensions including velocity profiles, bacterial density distributions, and single bacterial dynamics in shear flows. These measurements allow us to construct a simple heuristic model based on the boundary layer of upstream swimming bacteria near confining walls, which qualitatively explains our experimental observations. Our study sheds light on the influence of the boundary layer of collective bacterial motions on the flow of confined bacterial suspensions.

  abstract = {Due to its inherent out-of-equilibrium nature, active matter in confinement may exhibit collective behavior absent in unconfined systems. Extensive studies have indicated that hydrodynamic or steric interactions between active particles and boundary play an important role in the emergence of collective behavior. However, besides introducing external couplings at the single-particle level, the confinement also induces an inhomogeneous density distribution due to particle-position correlations, whose effect on collective behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigate this effect in a minimal chiral active matter composed of self-spinning rotors through simulation, experiment, and theory. We find that the density inhomogeneity leads to a position-dependent frictional stress that results from interrotor friction and couples the spin to the translation of the particles, which can then drive a striking spatially oscillating collective motion of the chiral active matter along the confinement boundary. Moreover, depending on the oscillation properties, the collective behavior has three different modes as the packing fraction varies. The structural origins of the transitions between the different modes are well identified by the percolation of solid-like regions or the occurrence of defect-induced particle rearrangement. Our results thus show that the confinement-induced inhomogeneity, dynamic structure, and compressibility have significant influences on collective behavior of active matter and should be properly taken into account.},

Our experiments demonstrate the existence and quantify the scaling relation of giant number fluctuations in 3D bacterial suspensions. Surprisingly, the anomalous scaling persists at small scales in low-concentration suspensions well before the transition to active turbulence, reflecting the long-range nature of hydrodynamic interactions of 3D wet active fluids. To illustrate the origin of the density fluctuations, we measure the energy spectra of suspension flows and explore the density\textendash energy coupling in both the steady and transient states of active turbulence. A scale-invariant density-independent correlation between density fluctuations and energy spectra is uncovered across a wide range of length scales.

The physics underlying this mode of motion has the same origins as that giving rise to the zero viscosity observed in bacterial suspensions. This topologically protected tractionless self-propusion provides a robust physical mechanism for efficient cell migration in crowded environments like tissues.},

  abstract = {Tumbling, a characteristic feature of the motility and chemotactic response of peritrichously flagellated bacteria, has been examined by dark-field light microscopy and found to be intimately linked to major changes in the quaternary structure of the flagella. The normal structure of the flagella of Salmonella is a left-handed helix of wavelength 2{$\cdot$}3 {$\mu$}m and diameter 0{$\cdot$}4 {$\mu$}m. Under right-handed torsion generated when the rotary motor is operating in reverse (i.e. in a clockwise sense), the normal structure undergoes a discrete transition to an alternative structure, designated ``curly'', which is a right-handed helix of wavelength 1{$\cdot$}1 {$\mu$}m and diameter 0{$\cdot$}3 {$\mu$}m. The transition proceeds rapidly from the cell body outward but is, at any instant, confined to a very short region of the flagellum. The heteromorphous structure of a flagellum in transition consists of two portions, normal and curly, with a change in axial direction of 64\textdegree{} occurring at the transition region. The chaotic motion of the cell body, in reaction to a number of flagella which are rotating and in transition, constitutes the tumble. The induction of polymorphic transitions by mechanical force is confirmed by studies with motor and flagellar mutants, and with cells converted to curly flagellar phenotype by p-fluorophenylalanine. The phenomenon of polymorphic transitions was examined most extensively in Salmonella, but is also noted in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli and may therefore be a general feature of bacterial flagellar structure. The right-handedness of the curly structures induced mechanically or by incorporation of p-fluorophenylalanine is also found for the curly structures caused by mutation or pH/ionic strength changes (Shimada et al., 1975). The reasons for the specific interaction between mechanical and molecular forces are discussed.},

A roughly linear relation between swimming speed and flagellar rotation rate was observed. The ratio of swimming speed to flagellar rotation rate was 0.113 microns, which indicated that a cell progressed by 7\% of pitch of flagellar helix during one flagellar rotation. At each temperature, however, swimming speed had a tendency to saturate at high flagellar rotation rate. That is, the cell with a faster-rotating flagellum did not always swim faster. To analyze the bacterial motion, we proposed a model in which the torque characteristics of the flagellar motor were considered. The model could be analytically solved, and it qualitatively explained the experimental results. The discrepancy between the experimental and the calculated ratios of swimming speed to flagellar rotation rate was about 20\%. The apparent saturation in swimming speed was considered to be caused by shorter flagella that rotated faster but produced less propelling force.},

Addition of polymer improved the propulsion efficiency, which surpasses the decline in flagellar rotation rate, and the swimming speed increased with viscosity.},

We find that the standard picture of density accumulation in slow regions is qualitatively modified by active fluctuations, as stationary density profiles are generally not determined only by the mean self-propulsion speed landscape. As a result, activity gradients generically correlate the particle self-propulsion speed and orientation, leading to emergent polarization at interfaces pointing either towards dense or dilute regions depending on the amount of noise in the system. We discuss how these features affect the onset of motility induced phase separation. Our work provides a foundation for systematic studies of active matter self-organization in the presence of activity landscapes and active fluctuations.},

Solid boundaries can strongly influence a cell's propulsion mechanism, thus leading many flagellated bacteria to describe long circular trajectories stably entrapped by the surface. Experimental studies on near-surface bacterial motility have, however, neglected the fact that real environments have typical microstructures varying on the scale of the cells' motion. Here, we show that micro-obstacles influence the propagation of peritrichously flagellated bacteria on a flat surface in a non-monotonic way. Instead of hindering it, an optimal, relatively low obstacle density can significantly enhance cells' propagation on surfaces due to individual forward-scattering events. This finding provides insight on the emerging dynamics of chiral active matter in complex environments and inspires possible routes to control microbial ecology in natural habitats.},

Because of destructive interference between the angular displacement of the system and the noise term, the energy fluctuations are reduced when the noise has a non-zero correlation time. We derive the long time behaviour of the pendulum in the case of Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck noise by a recursive adiabatic elimination procedure. An analytical expression for the asymptotic probability distribution function of the energy is obtained and the results agree with numerical simulations. Lastly, we compare our method with other approximation schemes.},

  abstract = {Swimming cells often have to self-propel through fluids displaying non-Newtonian rheology. While past theoretical work seems to indicate that stresses arising from complex fluids should systematically hinder low-Reynolds number locomotion, experimental observations suggest that locomotion enhancement is possible. In this paper we propose a physical mechanism for locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. It is based on the fact that microstructured fluids will generically phase-separate near surfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers, which promote slip and decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. We use two models to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent slip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of viscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. Considering two canonical setups for low-Reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a two-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that phase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by orders of magnitude. We close by confronting our predictions with recent experimental results.},

To reproduce the effects of the experimentally observed persistence of the trajectories of the active particles we consider a Gaussian force having a non-vanishing correlation time               {$\tau$}               , whose finiteness is a measure of the activity of the system. With these ingredients we show that it is possible to develop a statistical mechanical approach similar to the one employed in the study of equilibrium liquids and to obtain the explicit form of the many-particle distribution function by means of the multidimensional unified colored noise approximation. Such a distribution plays a role analogous to the Gibbs distribution in equilibrium statistical mechanics and provides complete information about the microscopic state of the system. From here we develop a method to determine the one- and two-particle distribution functions in the spirit of the Born\textendash Green\textendash Yvon (BGY) equations of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The resulting equations which contain extra-correlations induced by the activity allow us to determine the stationary density profiles in the presence of external fields, the pair correlations and the pressure of active fluids. In the low density regime we obtained the effective pair potential               {$\phi$}               (               r               ) acting between two isolated particles separated by a distance,               r               , showing the existence of an effective attraction between them induced by activity. Based on these results, in the second half of the paper we propose a mean field theory as an approach simpler than the BGY hierarchy and use it to derive a van der Waals expression of the equation of state.},

By summing a recursive series of image systems, we derive a numerically tractable approximation to the three-dimensional flow fields of a stokeslet (point force) within a viscous film between a parallel no-slip surface and a no-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows produced by a force- and torque-free micro-swimmer.

Engng Maths               , vol.~10~(4), 1976, pp.~287\textendash 303) to the film geometry, which demonstrates that the image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields if the film is sufficiently thick compared to the swimmer size, and we derive the swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick-film case, we find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at the no-slip wall rather than the water\textendash air interface, but that higher-order multipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions, we propose an experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular swimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's three-dimensional position under a microscope.},

The mechanisms of this `rheotaxis', the reorientation with respect to flow gradients, are still poorly understood. Here, we follow individual E. coli bacteria swimming at surfaces under shear flow using 3D Lagrangian tracking and fluorescent flagellar labelling. Three transitions are identified with increasing shear rate: Above a first critical shear rate, bacteria shift to swimming upstream. After a second threshold, we report the discovery of an oscillatory rheotaxis. Beyond a third transition, we further observe coexistence of rheotaxis along the positive and negative vorticity directions. A theoretical analysis explains these rheotaxis regimes and predicts the corresponding critical shear rates. Our results shed light on bacterial transport and reveal strategies for contamination prevention, rheotactic cell sorting, and microswimmer navigation in complex flow environments.},

  abstract = {A PIV algorithm is presented for estimating time-averaged or phase-averaged velocity fields. The algorithm can be applied to situations where signal strength is not sufficient for standard cross correlation techniques, such as a low number of particle images in an interrogation spot, or poor image quality. The algorithm can also be used to increase the spatial resolution of measurements by allowing smaller interrogation spots than those required for standard cross correlation techniques. The quality of the velocity measurements can be dramatically increased by averaging a series of instantaneous correlation functions, before determining the location of the signal peak, as opposed to the commonly used technique of estimating instantaneous velocity fields first and then averaging the velocity fields. The algorithm is applied to a 30{$\mu$}m\texttimes 300{$\mu$}m microchannel flow. [S0098-2202(00)00602-7]},

  abstract = {Aerotaxis, the directed migration along oxygen gradients, allows many microorganisms to locate favorable oxygen concentrations. Despite oxygen's fundamental role for life, even key aspects of aerotaxis remain poorly understood. In Bacillus subtilis, for example, there is conflicting evidence of whether migration occurs to the maximal oxygen concentration available or to an optimal intermediate one, and how aerotaxis can be maintained over a broad range of conditions. Using precisely controlled oxygen gradients in a microfluidic device, spanning the full spectrum of conditions from quasi-anoxic to oxic (60\,n\,mol/l\textendash 1\,m\,mol/l), we resolved B. subtilis' `oxygen preference conundrum' by demonstrating consistent migration towards maximum oxygen concentrations (`monotonic aerotaxis'). Surprisingly, the strength of aerotaxis was largely unchanged over three decades in oxygen concentration (131\,n\,mol/l\textendash 196\,{$\mu$}\,mol/l). We discovered that in this range B. subtilis responds to the logarithm of the oxygen concentration gradient, a rescaling strategy called `log-sensing' that affords organisms high sensitivity over a wide range of conditions. In these experiments, high-throughput single-cell imaging yielded the best signal-to-noise ratio of any microbial taxis study to date, enabling the robust identification of the first mathematical model for aerotaxis among a broad class of alternative models. The model passed the stringent test of predicting the transient aerotactic response despite being developed on steady-state data, and quantitatively captures both monotonic aerotaxis and log-sensing. Taken together, these results shed new light on the oxygen-seeking capabilities of B. subtilis and provide a blueprint for the quantitative investigation of the many other forms of microbial taxis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The induced diffusion of tracers in a bacterial suspension is studied theoretically and experimentally at low bacterial concentrations. Considering the swimmer\textendash tracer hydrodynamic interactions at low Reynolds number and using a kinetic theory approach, it is shown that the induced diffusion coefficient is proportional to the swimmer concentration, their mean velocity and a coefficient                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               , as observed experimentally. This paper shows that                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases as a result of the interaction with solid surfaces. The coefficient                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               scales as the tracer\textendash swimmer cross-section times the mean square displacement produced by single scattering events, which depends on the swimmer propulsion forces. Considering simple swimmer models (acting on the fluid as two monopoles or as a force dipole), it is shown that                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases for decreasing swimming efficiencies. Close to solid surfaces, the swimming efficiency degrades and, consequently, the induced diffusion increases. Experiments on wild-type               Escherichia coli               in a Hele-Shaw cell, under buoyant conditions, are performed to measure the induced diffusion on tracers near surfaces. The modification of the suspension pH varies the swimmers' velocity over a wide range, allowing the                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               coefficient to be extracted with precision. It is found that solid surfaces modify the induced diffusion: decreasing the confinement height of the cell,                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases by a factor of~4. The theoretical model reproduces this increase, although there are quantitative differences, probably attributed to the simplicity of the swimmer models and to the estimates for the parameters that model               E.~coli               .},

  abstract = {The postulational basis of classical thermodynamics has been expanded to incorporate equilibrium fluctuations. The main additional elements of the proposed thermodynamic theory are the concept of quasi-equilibrium states, a definition of nonequilibrium entropy, a fundamental equation of state in the entropy representation, and a fluctuation postulate describing the probability distribution of macroscopic parameters of an isolated system. Although these elements introduce a statistical component that does not exist in classical thermodynamics, the logical structure of the theory is different from that of statistical mechanics and represents an expanded version of thermodynamics. Based on this theory, we present a regular procedure for calculations of equilibrium fluctuations of extensive parameters, intensive parameters and densities in systems with any number of fluctuating parameters. The proposed fluctuation formalism is demonstrated by four applications: (1) derivation of the complete set of fluctuation relations for a simple fluid in three different ensembles; (2) fluctuations in finite-reservoir systems interpolating between the canonical and micro-canonical ensembles; (3) derivation of fluctuation relations for excess properties of grain boundaries in binary solid solutions, and (4) derivation of the grain boundary width distribution for pre-melted grain boundaries in alloys. The last two applications offer an efficient fluctuation-based approach to calculations of interface excess properties and extraction of the disjoining potential in pre-melted grain boundaries. Possible future extensions of the theory are outlined.},

Particles develop concentration profiles around them by dissolution, adsorption, or the reactivity of surface species. These gradients change the surface energy of the particles, driving both their self-propulsion and governing their interactions. Here, we uncover a regime in which solute gradients mediate interactions between slowly dissolving droplets without causing autophoresis. This decoupling allows us to directly measure the steady-state, repulsive force, which scales with interparticle distance as F{$\sim$}1/r2. Our results show that the dissolution process is diffusion rather than reaction rate limited, and the theoretical model captures the dependence of the interactions on droplet size and solute concentration, using a single fit parameter, l=16{$\pm$}3nm, which corresponds to the length scale of a swollen micelle. Our results shed light on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of particles with surface reactivity.},

The field of active matter focuses on understanding how the collective behaviours of internally driven components can give rise to these biological phenomena, while also striving to produce synthetic materials composed of active energy-consuming components. The synergistic approach of studying active matter in both living cells and reconstituted systems assembled from biochemical building blocks has the potential to transform our understanding of both cell biology and materials science. This methodology can provide insight into the fundamental principles that govern the dynamical behaviours of self-organizing subcellular structures, and can lead to the design of artificial materials and machines that operate away from equilibrium and can thus attain life-like properties. In this Review, we focus on active materials made of cytoskeletal components, highlighting the role of active stresses and how they drive self-organization of both cellular structures and macroscale materials, which are machines powered by nanomachines.},

Current tracking methods, based on a limited set of input parameters to identify bright objects, are ill-equipped to handle the spectrum of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and poor signal-to-noise ratios typically presented by submicron species in complex biological environments. Extensive user involvement is frequently necessary to optimize and execute tracking methods, which is not only inefficient but introduces user bias. To develop a fully automated tracking method, we developed a convolutional neural network for particle localization from image data, comprising over 6,000 parameters, and used machine learning techniques to train the network on a diverse portfolio of video conditions. The neural network tracker provides unprecedented automation and accuracy, with exceptionally low false positive and false negative rates on both 2D and 3D simulated videos and 2D experimental videos of difficult-to-track species.},

  abstract = {A complex fluid submitted to strong flows can endure irreversible changes in its structure. This is the case for long chain polymer additives that are commonly used as viscosity enhancers in industry, notably for oil recovery. These polymers break in solution when submitted to high deformation rates, eventually causing a serious viscosity loss. This problem of practical importance is though difficult to handle from a fundamental point of view given its complexity. We introduce here a new tool, based on microfluidic technology, for the screening of the degradation of solutions in the model situation of the flow through a constriction. We integrate two functions in a single set-up, a micro-fabricated constriction and an onchip viscosimeter. This tool enables us to probe rapidly the viscosity loss imparted by flowing through the constriction at a given flow rate. Thanks to microfluidics, the sample preparation and measurement time are significantly lower than those implied by classical measurement protocols (reduction by up to two orders of magnitude). In addition, confinement provides control of the flow in terms of inertia. To illustrate the potential of this approach in a screening perspective, we use this tool to study the degradation of a series of semi-dilute aqueous solutions of PEO of varying molecular weights and concentrations. For each solution we identify a threshold flow rate for polymer degradation. The corresponding critical deformation rate decreases with molecular weight and concentration, as expected (the mass dependence is in line with previous reports and theories for dilute solutions). In addition we characterize the viscosity loss for larger deformation rates and find that, despite the polydispersity of our solutions, the observations for the various solutions can be roughly recast on a master curve by renormalization of the imposed deformation rates according to a law Mw-1.7{$\pm$}03c-0.7{$\pm$}03.},

The material degradation process, which is coupled to the crack formation process, is described using a theoretical model and is numerically simulated using the finite-element method for a generic, charring, rubber-like material. In this model, a slab of material is subjected to an external, localized heat flux and, as the material degrades, cracks form when the local principal stress exceeds a defined cracking threshold. The magnitude of the cracking threshold               {$\sigma$}                                c                              is systematically varied in order to examine its influences on crack initiation, evolution, distribution and behaviour over time.

  abstract = {Tracer particles immersed in suspensions of biological microswimmers such as E. coli or C. reinhardtii display phenomena unseen in conventional equilibrium systems, including strongly enhanced diffusivity relative to the Brownian value and non-Gaussian displacement statistics. In dilute, three-dimensional suspensions, these phenomena have typically been explained by the hydrodynamic advection of point tracers by isolated microswimmers, while, at higher concentrations, correlations between pusher microswimmers such as E. coli can increase the effective diffusivity even further. Anisotropic tracers in active suspensions can be expected to exhibit even more complex behavior than spherical ones due to the presence of a nontrivial translation-rotation coupling. Using large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by extended force dipoles, we study the motion of ellipsoidal point tracers immersed in three-dimensional microswimmer suspensions. We find that the rotational diffusivity of tracers is much less affected by swimmer-swimmer correlations than the translational diffusivity. We furthermore study the anisotropic translational diffusion in the particle frame and find that, in pusher suspensions, the diffusivity along the ellipsoid major axis is higher than in the direction perpendicular to it, albeit with a smaller ratio than for Brownian diffusion. Thus, we find that far-field hydrodynamics cannot account for the anomalous coupling between the translation and rotation observed in experiments, as was recently proposed. Finally, we study the probability distributions (PDFs) of translational and rotational displacements. In accordance with experimental observations, for short observation times we observe strongly non-Gaussian PDFs that collapse when rescaled with their variance, which we attribute to the ballistic nature of tracer motion at short times.},

  abstract = {The immense diversity of microbial life found in the vadose zone reflects the extremely heterogeneous and highly dynamic aquatic and chemical environments formed within soil pore spaces. The notion of planktonian free swimming microbes is unrealistic under most unsaturated conditions. Experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that surface attachment is the prevailing lifestyle, where bacterial colonies are embedded in biosynthesized extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This strategy represents a successful adaptation to the variable and unpredictable hydration conditions near the earth surface. The EPS matrix serves as the interface with the environment; it enhances hydration and transport properties in the immediate vicinity of microbial cells, and dampens effects of highly transient fluctuations in water and nutrient fluxes. The primary effect of soil pore geometry and hydration status is on diffusion pathways to and away from stationary microbial colonies. Microbial dependency on diffusion processes occurs at all scales, but is particularly important at the colony scale. We illustrate the critical role of diffusion pathways with their complex spatial and temporal patterns in promoting coexistence and diversity. We review specific features and adaptations of microbial life to the particular conditions of terrestrial soil environments. The physical and related chemical conditions that shape microbial habitats and govern key processes in unsaturated soils are reviewed in a quantitative framework. Key physiological adaptations and biological responses to challenges presented by unsaturated conditions are discussed. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of microbial activity on properties and characteristics of the host porous medium. This review is an attempt to establish an interdisciplinary dialogue between hydrologists and microbiologists towards a quantitative integration of the role of hydrologic conditions on microbial activity and the role of microbiology in controlling macroscopic fluxes within this important compartment of the biosphere.},

  abstract = {The buoyant motion of a bubble rising through a continuous liquid phase can be retarded by the adsorption onto the bubble surface of surfactant dissolved in the liquid phase. The reason for this retardation is that adsorbed surfactant is swept to the trailing pole of the bubble where it accumulates and lowers the surface tension relative to the front end. The difference in tension creates a Marangoni force which opposes the surface flow, rigidifies the interface and increases the drag coefficient. Surfactant molecules adsorb onto the bubble surface by diffusing from the bulk to the sublayer of liquid adjoining the surface, and kinetically adsorbing from the sublayer onto the surface. The surface surfactant distribution which defines the Marangoni force is determined by the rate of kinetic adsorption and bulk diffusion relative to the rate of surface convection. In the limit in which the rate of either kinetic or diffusive transport of surfactant to the bubble surface is slow relative to surface convection and surface diffusion is also slow, surfactant collects in a stagnant cap at the back end of the bubble while the front end is stress free and mobile. The size of the cap and correspondingly the drag coefficient increases with the bulk concentration of surfactant until the cap covers the entire surface and the drag coefficient is that of a bubble with a completely tangentially immobile surface. Previous theoretical research on the stagnant cap regime has not studied in detail the competing roles of bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption in determining the size of the stagnant cap angle, and there have been only a few studies which have attempted to quantitatively correlate simulations with measurements.This paper provides a more complete theoretical study of and a validating set of experiments on the stagnant cap regime. We solve numerically for the cap angle and drag coefficient as a function of the bulk concentration of surfactant for a spherical bubble rising steadily with inertia in a Newtonian fluid, including both bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption. For the case of diffusion-limited transport (infinite adsorption kinetics), we show clearly that very small bulk concentrations can immobilize the entire surface, and we calculate the critical concentrations which immobilize the surface as a function of the surfactant parameters. We demonstrate that the effect of kinetics is to reduce the cap angle (hence reduce the drag coefficient) for a given bulk concentration of surfactant. We also present experimental results on the drag of a bubble rising in a glycerol\textendash water mixture, as a function of the dissolved concentration of a polyethoxylated non-ionic surfactant whose bulk diffusion coefficient and a lower bound on the kinetic rate constants have been obtained separately by measuring the reduction in dynamic tension as surfactant adsorbs onto a clean interface. For low concentrations of surfactant, the experiments measure drag coefficients which are intermediate between the drag coefficient of a bubble whose surface is tangentially mobile and one whose surface is completely immobilized. Using the separately obtained value for the diffusion coefficient of the polyethoxylate, we undertake simulations which provide, upon comparison with the measured drag coefficients, a tighter bound on the kinetic rate constants than were otherwise obtained using dynamic surface tension measurement, and this suggests a new method for the measurement of kinetic rate constants.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to represent a given 2D shape with an automatically determined number of ellipses, so that the total area covered by the ellipses is equal to the area of the original shape without any assumption or prior knowledge about the object structure. To solve this interesting theoretical problem, first we employ the skeleton of the 2D shape which provides important information on the parameters of the ellipses that could approximate the original shape. For a given number of such ellipses, the hard ExpectationMaximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to maximise the shape coverage under the Equal Area constraint. Different models (i.e., solutions involving different numbers of ellipses) are evaluated based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This considers a novel, entropy-based shape complexity measure that balances the model complexity and the model approximation error. In order to minimise the AIC criterion, two variants are proposed and evaluated: (a) the augmentative method that gradually increases the number of considered ellipses starting from a single one and (b) the decremental method that decreases the number of ellipses starting from a large, automatically defined set. The obtained quantitative results on more than 4000 2D shapes included in standard as well as in custom datasets, quantify the performance of the proposed methods and illustrate that their solutions agree with human intuition. \& 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model's generic simplicity allows us to quantify the observed enhanced Gaussian or non-Gaussian diffusion in an active bath.           ,              Particles kicked by external forces to produce mobility distinct from thermal diffusion are an iconic feature of the active matter problem. Here, we map this onto a minimal model for experiment and theory covering the wide time and length scales of usual active matter systems. A particle diffusing in a harmonic potential generated by an optical trap is kicked by programmed forces with time correlation at random intervals following the Poisson process. The model's generic simplicity allows us to find conditions for which displacements are Gaussian (or not), how diffusion is perturbed (or not) by kicks, and quantifying heat dissipation to maintain the non-equilibrium steady state in an active bath. The model reproduces experimental results of tracer mobility in an active bath of swimming algal cells. It can be used as a stochastic dynamic simulator for Brownian objects in various active baths without mechanistic understanding, owing to the generic framework of the protocol.},

Mutants of the "cheA" class defined two genes, cheA and cheW, which appeared to be contranscribed. Mutants of the "cheB" class defined four genes, cheX, cheB, cheY, and cheZ, which also constituted a transcriptional unit. Mutants defective in cheA, cheW, cheX, or cheY function swam smoothly, with little or no tumbling, whereas cheB or cheZ mutants exhibited very high tumbling rates. These functions are probably involved in initiating of controlling changes in flagellar rotation in response to chemotactic stimuli.},

Here, we experimentally investigate the run-and-tumble dynamics of the bacterium E. coli in polymeric solutions. We find that even small amounts of polymer in solution can drastically change E. coli dynamics: cells tumble less and their velocity increases, leading to an enhancement in cell translational diffusion and a sharp decline in rotational diffusion. We show that suppression of tumbling is due to fluid viscosity while the enhancement in swimming speed is mainly due to fluid elasticity. Visualization of single fluorescently labeled DNA polymers reveals that the flow generated by individual E. coli is sufficiently strong to stretch polymer molecules and induce elastic stresses in the fluid, which in turn can act on the cell in such a way to enhance its transport. Our results show that the transport and spread of chemotactic cells can be independently modified and controlled by the fluid material properties.},

Using particles covering a range of sizes from 0.6 to 39 microns, we probe particle dynamics at both short and long time scales. In all cases, the particles exhibit super-diffusive ballistic behavior at short times before eventually transitioning to diffusive behavior. Surprisingly, we find a regime in which larger particles can diffuse faster than smaller particles: the particle long-time effective diffusivity exhibits a peak in particle size, which is a deviation from classical thermal diffusion. We also find that the active contribution to particle diffusion is controlled by a dimensionless parameter, the P\'eclet number. A minimal model qualitatively explains the existence of the effective diffusivity peak and its dependence on bacterial concentration. Our results have broad implications on characterizing active fluids using concepts drawn from classical thermodynamics.},

Depending on the initial conditions, the swimmer can either escape from the free-slip surface or collide with the boundary. Interestingly, the micro-organism does not exhibit a stable orbit. Independently of escape or attraction to the interface, close to a free-slip surface, the swimmer follows a counter-clockwise trajectory, in agreement with experimental findings (Di Leonardo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106 (3), 2011, 038101). The hydrodynamics is indeed modified by the free surface. In fact, when the same swimmer moves close to a no-slip wall, a set of initial conditions exists which result in stable orbits. Moreover, when moving close to a free-slip or a no-slip boundary, the swimmer assumes a different orientation with respect to its trajectory. Taken together, these results contribute to shed light on the hydrodynamical behaviour of micro-organisms close to liquid\textendash air interfaces which are relevant for the formation of interfacial biofilms of aerobic bacteria.},

The dynamics of these systems are better understood and controlled considering their interaction with the environment, which for realistic systems is often highly heterogeneous and disordered. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of spatial disorder can alter the long-term dynamics in a colloidal active matter system, making it switch between gathering and dispersal of individuals. At equilibrium, colloidal particles always gather at the bottom of any attractive potential; however, under non-equilibrium driving forces in a bacterial bath, the colloids disperse if disorder is added to the potential. The depth of the local roughness in the environment regulates the transition between gathering and dispersal of individuals in the active matter system, thus inspiring novel routes for controlling emerging behaviours far from equilibrium.},

Synthetic self-propelled particles have also become available recently, such as two-faced, or Janus, particles propelled by differential chemical reactions on their surfaces driving a self-phoretic motion. In these lectures, I give a pedagogical introduction to the physics of single-particle and collective properties of active colloids, focussing on self propulsion. I will compare and contrast phenomena in suspensions of `swimmers' with the behaviour of suspensions of passive particles, where only Brownian motion (discovered by Robert Brown in granules from the pollen of the wild flower Clarkia pulchella) is relevant. I will pay particular attention to issues that pertain to performing experiments using these active particle suspensions, such as how to characterise the suspension's swimming speed distribution, and include an appendix to guide physicists wanting to start culturing motile bacteria.},

The method allows simulation and modeling of mixing fluids with different physical properties, fluid interactions with stationary objects, and fluids that exhibit significant interface breakup and fragmentation. The gridless computational method is suited for medium scale problems since computational elements exist only where needed. The method fits well into the current user interaction paradigm and allows easy user control over the desired fluid motion.},

  abstract = {Particle-laden fluid interfaces are the central component of many natural and engineering systems. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to understand the mechanical properties and improve the stability of such interfaces. Here, we explore the effect of Janus particle additives on the interfacial rheology and microscopic structure of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Using a custom-built interfacial stress rheometer, we show that the addition of a small amount of platinum-polystyrene (Pt-PS) Janus particles within a monolayer of PS colloids (1:40 number ratio) can lead to more than an order-ofmagnitude increase in surface moduli with significantly enhanced elasticity, which greatly improves the stability of the interface. This drastic change in interfacial rheology is associated with the formation of local particle clusters surrounding each Janus particle. We further explain the origin of local particle clusters by considering the interparticle interactions at the interface. Our experiments reveal the effect of local particle structures on the macroscopic rheological behaviors of particle monolayers and demonstrate a new way to tune the microstructure and mechanical properties of particle-laden fluid interfaces.},

The swimming mode of wild-type E. coli is often idealized as a run-and-tumble sequence in which periods of swimming at a constant speed are randomly interrupted by a sudden change of direction at a very low speed. Using a tracking microscope, we follow cells for extended periods of time in Newtonian liquids of varying viscosity and find that the swimming behavior of a single cell can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including run and tumble and "slow random walk" in which the cells move at a relatively low speed. Although the characteristic swimming speed varies between individuals and in different polymer solutions, we find that the skewness of the speed distribution is solely a function of viscosity and can be used, in concert with the measured average swimming speed, to determine the effective running speed of each cell. We hypothesize that differences in the swimming behavior observed in solutions of different viscosity are due to changes in the flagellar bundling time, which increases as the viscosity rises, due to the lower rotation rate of the flagellar motor. A numerical simulation and the use of resistive force theory provide support for this hypothesis.},

We report on the behavior of wild-type and smooth-swimming E. coli in Newtonian, shear-thinning, and viscoelastic media, measuring their trajectories and swimming speed using a three-dimensional real-time tracking microscope. We conclude that the speed enhancement in Methocel solution at higher concentrations is due to shear thinning and an analytical model is used to support our experimental result. We argue that shear-induced normal stresses reduce wobbling behavior during cell swimming but do not significantly affect swimming speed. However, the normal stresses play an important role in decreasing the flagellar bundling time, which changes the swimming-speed distribution. A dimensionless number, the ``strangulation number'' (Str) is proposed and used to characterize this effect.},

Streamlining active matter is especially important at the microscale, where the viscous forces prevail over inertia and transport requires a non-reciprocal motion. Here we report that microscopic active droplets representing aqueous dispersions of swimming bacteria Bacillus subtilis become unidirectionally motile when placed in an inactive nematic liquid-crystal medium. Random motion of bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into a directional self-locomotion of the droplet by the polar director structure that the droplet creates in the surrounding nematic through anisotropic molecular interactions at its surface. Droplets without active swimmers show no net displacement. The trajectory of the active droplet can be predesigned by patterning the molecular orientation of the nematic. The effect demonstrates that broken spatial symmetry of the medium can be the reason for and the means to control directional microscale transport.},

We show that the persistence time, diffusion coefficient and average speed increase with the bacterial concentration inside the drop, but are largely independent of the droplet size. By measuring the turbulent-like motion of the bacteria inside the drop, we demonstrate that the mean velocity of the bacteria near the bottom of the drop, which is separated from a glass substrate by a thin lubrication oil film, is antiparallel to the instantaneous velocity of the drop. This suggests that the driving mechanism is a slippery rolling of the drop over the substrate, caused by the collective motion of the bacteria. Our results show that microscopic organisms can transfer useful mechanical energy to their confining environment, opening the way to the assembly of mesoscopic motors composed of microswimmers.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

The algorithm presented here achieves two major goals; a more accurate estimation of D as well as extracting information about the short time behavior. The algorithm fits the MSD to a continuous piece-wise function and predicts all the coefficients in the model including the breakpoints. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to find the breakpoints which separate different modes of motion. We tested our algorithm using numerical experiments, and our fits described the data remarkably well. In addition, we applied our algorithm to extract D for water based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The results of our fits are in good agreement with the experimentally reported values.},

  abstract = {Many environments on Earth experience nutrient limitation and as a result have nongrowing or very slowly growing bacterial populations. To better understand bacterial respiration under environmentally relevant conditions, the effect of nutrient limitation on respiration rates of heterotrophic bacteria was measured. The oxygen consumption and population density of batch cultures of Escherichia coli K-12, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 were tracked for up to 200 days. The oxygen consumption per CFU (QO2) declined by more than 2 orders of magnitude for all three strains as they transitioned from nutrient-abundant log-phase growth to the nutrient-limited early stationary phase. The large reduction in QO2 from growth to stationary phase suggests that nutrient availability is an important factor in considering environmental respiration rates. Following the death phase, during the long-term stationary phase (LTSP), QO2 values of the surviving population increased with time and more cells were respiring than formed colonies. Within the respiring population, a subpopulation of highly respiring cells increased in abundance with time. Apparently, as cells enter LTSP, there is a viable but not culturable population whose bulk community and per cell respiration rates are dynamic. This result has a bearing on how minimal energy requirements are met, especially in nutrient-limited environments. The minimal QO2 rates support the extension of Kleiber's law to the mass of a bacterium (100-fg range).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION             Understanding complex cellular processes requires investigating the underlying mechanisms within a spatiotemporal context. Although cellular processes are dynamic in nature, most studies in molecular cell biology are based on fixed specimens, for example, using immunocytochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques, in particular, the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its spectral variants, have facilitated the study of a wide range of dynamic processes by allowing nondestructive labeling of target structures in living cells. In addition, the tremendous improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of light microscopes now allow cellular processes to be analyzed in unprecedented detail. These state-of-the-art imaging technologies, however, provide a huge amount of digital image data. To cope with the enormous amount of image data and to extract reproducible as well as quantitative information, computer-based image analysis is required. In this article, we describe methods for computer-based analysis of multidimensional live cell microscopy images and their application to study the dynamics of cells and particles. First, we sketch a general workflow for quantitative analysis of live cell images. Then, we detail computational methods for automatic image analysis comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, registration, tracking, and classification. We conclude with a discussion of quantitative analysis and systems biology.},

Passive fluctuations (e.g., thermal fluctuations) are independent of the orientation of the particle. In contrast, active ones point parallel or perpendicular to the time dependent orientation of the particle. We derive analytical expressions for the speed and velocity probability density for a generic model of active Brownian particles, which yields an increased probability of low speeds in the presence of active fluctuations in comparison to the case of purely passive fluctuations. As a consequence, we predict sharply peaked Cartesian velocity probability densities at the origin. Finally, we show that such a behavior may also occur in non-Gaussian active fluctuations and discuss briefly correlations of the fluctuating stochastic forces.},

  abstract = {When thin films of colloidal fluids are dried, a range of transitions are observed and the final film profile is found to depend on the processes that occur during the drying step. This article describes the drying process, initially concentrating on the various transitions. Particles are seen to initially consolidate at the edge of a drying droplet, the so-called coffee-ring effect. Flow is seen to be from the centre of the drop towards the edge and a front of close-packed particles passes horizontally across the film. Just behind the particle front the now solid film often displays cracks and finally the film is observed to de-wet. These various transitions are explained, with particular reference to the capillary pressure which forms in the solidified region of the film. The reasons for cracking in thin films is explored as well as various methods to minimize its effect. Methods to obtain stratified coatings through a single application are considered for a one-dimensional drying problem and this is then extended to two-dimensional films. Different evaporative models are described, including the physical reason for enhanced evaporation at the edge of droplets. The various scenarios when evaporation is found to be uniform across a drying film are then explained. Finally different experimental techniques for examining the drying step are mentioned and the article ends with suggested areas that warrant further study.},

  abstract = {The study of collective motion in bacterial suspensions has been of significant recent interest. To better understand the non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations emerging in the course of collective swimming in suspensions of motile bacteria, a simple model is employed: a bacterium is represented as a force dipole with size, through the use of a short-range repelling potential, and shape. The model emphasizes two fundamental mechanisms: dipolar hydrodynamic interactions and short-range bacterial collisions. Using direct particle simulations validated by a dedicated experiment, we show that changing the swimming speed or concentration alters the time scale of sustained collective motion, consistent with experiment. Also, the correlation length in the collective state is almost constant as concentration and swimming speed change even though increasing each greatly increases the input of energy to the system. We demonstrate that the particle shape is critical for the onset of collective effects. In addition, new experimental results are presented illustrating the onset of collective motion with an ultrasound technique.},

  abstract = {A simple kinetic model is presented for the shear rheology of a dilute suspension of particles swimming at low Reynolds number. If interparticle hydrodynamic interactions are neglected, the configuration of the suspension is characterized by the particle orientation distribution, which satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation including the effects of the external shear flow, rotary diffusion, and particle tumbling. The orientation distribution then determines the leading-order term in the particle extra stress in the suspension, which can be evaluated based on the classic theory of Hinch and Leal (J Fluid Mech 52(4):683\textendash 712, 1972), and involves an additional contribution arising from the permanent force dipole exerted by the particles as they propel themselves through the fluid. Numerical solutions of the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation were obtained using a spectral method, and results are reported for the shear viscosity and normal stress difference coefficients in terms of flow strength, rotary diffusivity, and correlation time for tumbling. It is found that the rheology is characterized by much stronger normal stress differences than for passive suspensions, and that tailactuated swimmers result in a strong decrease in the effective shear viscosity of the fluid.},

A detailed model is proposed for a slender rod-like particle that propels itself in a viscous fluid by exerting a prescribed tangential stress on its surface, and a method is devised for the efficient calculation of hydrodynamic interactions in large-scale suspensions of such particles using slender-body theory and a smooth particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. Simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions for various system sizes and suspension volume fractions, and demonstrate a transition to large-scale correlated motions in suspensions of rear-actuated swimmers, or Pushers, above a critical volume fraction or system size. This transition, which is not observed in suspensions of head-actuated swimmers, or Pullers, is seen most clearly in particle velocity and passive tracer statistics. These observations are consistent with predictions from our previous mean-field kinetic theory, one of which states that instabilities will arise in uniform isotropic suspensions of Pushers when the product of the linear system size with the suspension volume fraction exceeds a given threshold. We also find that the collective dynamics of Pushers result in giant number fluctuations, local alignment of swimmers and strongly mixing flows. Suspensions of Pullers, which evince no large-scale dynamics, nonetheless display interesting deviations from the random isotropic state.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of a thin, axisymmetric, partially wetting drop as it evaporates. The effects of viscous dissipation, capillarity, slip, gravity, surface-tension gradients, and contact-angle hysteresis are taken into account in the regime in which the transport of vapour is dominated by diffusion. We find a criterion for when the contact-set radius close to extinction evolves as the square-root of the time remaining until extinction | the famous d2-law. However, for a sufficiently large rate of evaporation, our analysis predicts that a `d13=7-law' is more appropriate. We also determine how each of the physical effects in our model influences the evolution of the drop and hence its extinction time. Our asymptotic results are validated by comparison with numerical simulations. We then revisit our model for the vapour phase and take kinetic effects into account through a linear constitutive law that states that the mass flux through the drop surface is proportional to the difference between the vapour concentration in equilibrium and that at the interface. We perform a local analysis near the contact line to investigate the way in which kinetic effects regularize the mass-flux singularity at the contact line. The problem is further analysed via a matched asymptotic analysis in the physically relevant regime in which the kinetic timescale is much smaller than the diffusive one. We find that the effect of kinetics is limited to an inner region near the contact line, in which kinetic effects enter at leading order and cause the vapour concentration at the free surface to deviate from its equilibrium value. We also derive an explicit expression for the mass flux through the free surface of the drop.},

  abstract = {Summary: Ceil mass, the average number of nuclei/cell and the content of RNA and DNA were studied in (Salmonella typhimurium during balanced (steady state) growth in different media. These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.,},

  abstract = {Over the last four decades, particle image velocimetry (PIV) has evolved into a powerful and significant measurement technique. The technique has been applied to many areas of fluid mechanics and the accuracy and resolution has been greatly improved over the years. This was made possible by the creativity, enthusiasm and commitment of the developers, but also by the technical achievements in the field of tracer particles, light sources, recording systems, algorithms and computer power. Although time-resolved volumetric PIV measurements are possible today, the majority of measurements are still performed using planar PIV techniques for good reasons. First, planar PIV is rather simple to both install and use and the data is processed quickly and robustly. Second, in many cases planar PIV already provides the desired data to answer scientific questions. Due to the persistent interest in using planar PIV, it is the intention of this review to consider some classical operating rules from today's perspective and to prove their validity. This may seem needless at first glance. However, it should be noted that once a technique has been established, the basic aspects are generally taken for granted. Therefore, a critical look from time to time is advisable to check whether the concepts are still valid or whether changes are necessary. Furthermore, we intend to deduce under which conditions the use of more complicated techniques pays off.},

When dealing with active nanoparticles, however, the overwhelming presence of rotational diffusion hinders directed motion, leading to an increase of their effective temperature, but otherwise masking the effects of self-propulsion. Here, we demonstrate an experimental system where an active nanoparticle immersed in a critical solution and held in an optical harmonic potential features far-from-equilibrium behavior beyond an increase of its effective temperature. When increasing the laser power, we observe a cross-over from a Boltzmann distribution to a non-equilibrium state, where the particle performs fast orbital rotations about the beam axis. These findings are rationalized by solving the Fokker-Planck equation for the particle's position and orientation in terms of a moment expansion. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism results from the particle's non-sphericity and the lower critical point of the solution.},

We demonstrate that this transition is controlled solely by a nondimensional number H involving twist, friction coefficient, and geometric lengths. A critical value of this number Hc{$\simeq$}30 can be linked to a locking of the fibers together as the tensile strength is reached. This critical value imposes that yarns must be very slender structures with a given pitch. It also induces the existence of an optimal yarn radius. Predictions of our theory are successfully compared to yarns made from natural cotton fibers.},

Cohesion arises at a common length scale ({$\sim$}5 {$\mu$}m), where interparticle attractive forces exceed particle weight. In polydisperse mixtures, smaller particles condense within shrinking capillary bridges to build stabilizing ``solid bridges'' among larger grains. This dynamic repeats across scales, forming remarkably strong, hierarchical clusters, whose cohesion derives from grain size rather than mineralogy. These results may help toward understanding the strength and erodibility of natural soils, and other polydisperse particulates that experience transient hydrodynamic forces.},

  abstract = {The effective viscosity of a dilute emulsion of spherical drops containing a soluble surfactant is calculated under a linear creeping flow. It is assumed that convection of surfactant is small relative to diffusion, and thus the Peclet number, P e, is small. We calculate the effective viscosity of the emulsion to O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}), where {$\varphi$} is the small volume fraction of the dispersed drops and {$\mu$} is the viscosity of the surfactant-free suspending fluid. This O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}) contribution is a sensitive function of the bulk and interfacial surfactant transport. Specifically, soluble surfactant molecules diffuse from the bulk to the interface and then adsorb to the interface. The ratio of the time scale for bulk diffusion to the time scale for adsorption to the interface is quantified by a Damkohler number, Da. The adsorption of surfactant to the interface may cause a significant decrease in the bulk concentration, which is known as depletion. The impact of depletion is characterized by two parameters: h, which is a dimensionless depletion depth; and k, which is the ratio of the desorption time scale to the adsorption time scale. We analytically determine how the O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}) contribution to the effective viscosity depends on h, k, and Da. Surprisingly, for certain regimes in the h - k - Da parameter space, we predict the effective viscosity of the emulsion to be greater than Einstein's result for the viscosity of a suspension of rigid spheres. Large Marangoni stresses driven by convective transport of soluble surfactant molecules are responsible for this result.},

Here, we explore how rod-shaped bacterial cells regulate their morphology during rapid environmental changes. We quantify cellular dimensions throughout passage cycles of stationary-phase cells diluted into fresh medium and grown back to saturation. We find that cells exhibit characteristic dynamics in surface area to volume ratio (SA/V), which are conserved across genetic and chemical perturbations as well as across species and growth temperatures. A mathematical model with a single fitting parameter (the time delay between surface and volume synthesis) is quantitatively consistent with our SA/V experimental observations. The model supports that this time delay is due to differential expression of volume and surface-related genes, and that the first division after dilution occurs at a tightly controlled SA/V. Our minimal model thus provides insight into the connections between bacterial growth rate and cell shape in dynamic environments.},

This model predicts a stochastic transition between a loosely attached, finite layer of bacteria near the surface and a growing biofilm. The transition is governed by two key parameters: the collective transition density relative to the carrying capacity and the immigration rate relative to the detachment rate. Biofilm initiation is complex, but our model suggests that stochastic nucleation phenomena may be relevant.},

  abstract = {Active matter exhibits various forms of non-equilibrium states in the absence of external forcing, including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modelled from first principles and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models. These have mostly been studied in the case of "dry" active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to "wet" active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modelled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology is well-established: at sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial turbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field assumption, and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behaviour is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs ( 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called -dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ( 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.},

  abstract = {A motile bacterium swims by generating flow in its surrounding liquid. Anisotropy of the suspending liquid significantly modifies the swimming dynamics and corresponding flow signatures of an individual bacterium and impacts collective behavior. We study the interactions between swimming bacteria in an anisotropic environment exemplified by lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal. Our analysis reveals a significant localization of the bacteria-induced flow along a line coaxial with the bacterial body, which is due to strong viscosity anisotropy of the liquid crystal. Despite the fact that the average viscosity of the liquid crystal is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of pure water, the speed of bacteria in the liquid crystal is of the same order of magnitude as in water. We show that bacteria can transport a cargo (a fluorescent particle) along a predetermined trajectory defined by the direction of molecular orientation of the liquid crystal. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic interaction between flagella of two close-by bacteria is negligible, the observed convergence of the swimming speeds as well as flagella waves' phase velocities may occur due to viscoelastic interaction between the bacterial bodies.},

The porous medium was simulated by enclosing, between slide and cover slip, a bacterial-culture sample mixed with uniform 2.98-{$\mu$}m-diameter spherical latex particles. The porosity of the medium was controlled by changing the latex particle concentration. By statistically analyzing several trajectory parameters (instantaneous velocity, turn angle, mean squared displacement, etc.), and contrasting with the results of a random-walk model developed ad hoc, we were able to quantify the effects that different obstacle concentrations have upon bacterial motility.},

Here we review the development, present state, and future directions of this field. We organize our review around the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation (GSER), which plays a central role in the interpretation of microrheology. By discussing the Stokes and Einstein components of the GSER individually, we identify the key assumptions that underpin each, and the consequences that occur when they are violated. We conclude with a discussion of two techniques\textemdash multiple particle-tracking and nonlinear microrheology\textemdash that have arisen to handle systems in which the GSER breaks down.},

We observe that when a dense sphere is rotated near a wall (the rotation being aligned with the wall-normal direction and gravity), it levitates to a fixed distance away from the wall. Since the shear is larger in the gap (between the sphere and the wall) than in the open side of the sphere, the shear-induced elastic stresses are thus asymmetric, resulting in a net elastic vertical force that balances the weight of the sphere. We conduct experiments, theoretical models and numerical simulations for rotating spheres of various sizes and densities in a Boger-type fluid. In the small-Deborah-number range, the results are collapsed into a universal trend by considering a dimensionless group of the ratio of elastic to gravitational forces.},

  abstract = {We examine the stability of a suspension of swimming bacteria in a Newtonian medium. The bacteria execute a run-and-tumble motion, runs being periods when a bacterium on average swims in a given direction; runs are interrupted by tumbles, leading to an abrupt, albeit correlated, change in the swimming direction. An instability is predicted to occur in a suspension of `pushers' (e.g.               E. Coli               ,               Bacillus subtilis               , etc.), and owes its origin to the intrinsic force dipoles of such bacteria. Unlike the dipole induced in an inextensible fibre subject to an axial straining flow, the forces constituting the dipole of a pusher are directed outward along its axis. As a result, the anisotropy in the orientation distribution of bacteria due to an imposed velocity perturbation drives a disturbance velocity field that acts to reinforce the perturbation. For long wavelengths, the resulting destabilizing bacterial stress is Newtonian but with a negative viscosity. The suspension becomes unstable when the total viscosity becomes negative.

The threshold concentration diverges in the limit ((15{$\mathscr{G}$}(               r               )/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               )) (                                D                 r                              L               /               U               )(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              ))) \textrightarrow{} 1. This limit defines a critical swimming speed,                                U                 crit                              = (                                D                 r                              L               )(15{$\mathscr{G}$}(               r               )/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ))(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              )). For speeds smaller than this critical value, the destabilizing bacterial stress remains subdominant and a dilute suspension of these swimmers therefore responds to long-wavelength perturbations in a manner similar to a suspension of passive rigid particles, that is, with a net enhancement in viscosity proportional to the bacterial concentration.                                         On the other hand, the stability analysis predicts that the above threshold concentration reduces to zero in the limit                                D                 r                              \textrightarrow{} 0, {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}, and a suspension of non-interacting straight swimmers is therefore always unstable. It is then argued that the dominant effect of hydrodynamic interactions in a dilute suspension of such swimmers is via an interaction-driven orientation decorrelation mechanism. The latter arises from uncorrelated pair interactions in the limit               nL               3               {$\ll$} 1, and for slender bacteria in particular, it takes the form of a hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity (                                D                 h                 r                              ); for               E. Coli               , we find                                D                 h                 r                              = 9.4 \texttimes{} 10               -5               (               nUL               2               ). From the above expression for the threshold concentration, it may be shown that even a weakly interacting suspension of slender smooth-swimming bacteria (               r               {$\gg$} 1, {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ) {$\approx$} 1, {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}) will be stable provided                                D                 h                 r                              {$>$} (               C               /30)(               nUL               2               ) in the limit               nL               3               {$\ll$} 1. The hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity of               E. Coli               is, however, too small to stabilize a dilute suspension of these swimmers, and a weakly interacting suspension of               E. Coli               remains unstable.},

Here we present some analytic and numerical results for models of the ideal (low-density) limit in which the particles have no hydrodynamic or other interactions and hence undergo independent motions. We address three cases: sedimentation under gravity; confinement by a harmonic external potential; and rectification by a strip of ``funnel gates'' which we model by a zone in which tumble rate depends on swim direction. We compare our results with recent experimental and simulation literature and highlight similarities and differences with the diffusive motion of colloidal particles.},

The swimming trajectory is governed by a competition between the orienting influence (               i.e.               , taxis) associated with the external (               e.g.               , magnetic, gravitational, thermal, nutrient concentration) field               versus               the effects that randomize the particle orientations (               e.g.               , rotary Brownian motion and/or an intrinsic tumbling mechanism like the flagella of bacteria). The swimmers' motion is characterized by a mean drift velocity and an effective translational diffusivity that becomes anisotropic in the presence of the orienting field. Since the diffusivity yields information about the micromechanical stress, the anisotropy generated by the external field creates a normal stress difference in the recently developed ``swim stress'' tensor [Takatori, Yan, and Brady,               Phys. Rev. Lett.               , 2014]. This property can be exploited in the design of soft, compressible materials in which their size, shape, and motion can be manipulated and tuned by loading the material with active swimmers. Since the swimmers exert different normal stresses in different directions, the material can compress/expand, elongate, and translate depending on the external field strength. Such an active system can be used as nano/micromechanical devices and motors. Analytical solutions are corroborated by Brownian dynamics simulations.},

Developing a tweezer with a trapping radius large compared with the swimmers' size and run length has been an experimental challenge, as standard optical traps are too weak. Here we report the novel use of an acoustic tweezer to confine self-propelled particles in two dimensions over distances large compared with the swimmers' run length. We develop a near-harmonic trap to demonstrate the crossover from weak confinement, where the probability density is Boltzmann-like, to strong confinement, where the density is peaked along the perimeter. At high concentrations the swimmers crystallize into a close-packed structure, which subsequently `explodes' as a travelling wave when the tweezer is turned off. The swimmers' confined motion provides a measurement of the swim pressure, a unique mechanical pressure exerted by self-propelled bodies.},

Many advances have been made in understanding and controlling the defect dynamics in active6\textendash 9 and passive9,10 non-equilibrium fluids. Yet, it remains unknown whether the statistical laws that govern the dynamics of defects in classical11 or quantum fluids12\textendash 14 extend to the active matter7,15,16 and information flows17,18 in living systems.

Our experiments reveal that the phase velocity field extracted from Rho-GTP concentration waves exhibits vortical defect motions and annihilation dynamics reminiscent of those seen in quantum systems12,13, bacterial turbulence15 and active nematics7. Several key statistics and scaling laws of the defect dynamics can be captured by a minimal Helmholtz\textendash Onsager point vortex model21 as well as a generic complex Ginzburg\textendash Landau22 continuum theory, suggesting a close correspondence between the biochemical signal propagation on the surface of a living cell and a widely studied class of two-dimensional turbulence23 and wave22 phenomena.},

  abstract = {This review is devoted to the simple process of drying a multicomponent droplet of a complex fluid which may contain salt or other inclusions. These processes provide a fascinating subject for study. The explanation of the rich variety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge but also a problem of practical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and improvement of coating/printing technology. The fundamental scientific problem is the study of the mechanism of micro- and nanoparticle self-organization in open systems. The specific fundamental problems to be solved, related to this system, are the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and evolution of phase fronts, and the identification of mechanisms of pattern formation. The drops of liquid containing dissolved substances and suspended particles are assumed to be drying on a horizontal solid insoluble smooth substrate. The chemical composition and macroscopic properties of the complex fluid, the concentration and nature of the salt, the surface energy of the substrate, and the interaction between the fluid and substrate which determines the wetting all affect the final morphology of the dried film. The range of our study encompasses the fully wetting case with zero contact angle between the fluid and substrate to the case where the drop is levitated in space, so there is no contact with a substrate and angle of contact can be considered as 180\textdegree.},

  abstract = {Evaporation-induced particle deposition patterns like coffee rings provide easy visual identification that is beneficial for developing inexpensive and simple diagnostic devices for detecting pathogens. In this study, the effect of chemotaxis on such pattern formation has been realized experimentally in drying droplets of bacterial suspensions. We have investigated the velocity field, concentration profile, and deposition pattern in the evaporating droplet of Escherichia coli suspension in the presence and absence of nutrients. Flow visualization experiments using particle image velocimetry (PIV) were carried out with E. coli bacteria as biological tracer particles. Experiments were conducted for suspensions of motile (live) as well as nonmotile (dead) bacteria. In the absence of any nutrient gradient like sugar on the substrate, both types of bacterial suspension showed two symmetric convection cells and a ring like deposition of particles after complete evaporation. Interestingly, the droplet containing live bacterial suspension showed a different velocity field when the sugar was placed at the base of the droplet. This can be attributed to the chemoattractant nature of the sugar, which induced chemotaxis among live bacteria targeted toward the nutrient site. Deposition of the suspended bacteria was also displaced toward the nutrient site as the evaporation proceeded. Our experiments demonstrate that both velocity fields and concentration patterns can be altered by chemotaxis to modify the pattern formation in evaporating droplet containing live bacteria. These results highlight the role of bacterial chemotaxis in modifying coffee ring patterns.},

  abstract = {Active particles, including swimming microorganisms, autophoretic colloids, and droplets, are known to self-organize into ordered structures at fluid\textendash solid boundaries. The entrainment of particles in the attractive parts of their spontaneous flows has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Here, combining experiments, theory, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the validity of this flow-induced ordering mechanism in a suspension of active emulsion droplets. We show that the mechanism can be controlled, with a variety of resultant ordered structures, by simply altering hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Thus, for flow in Hele\textendash Shaw cells, metastable lines or stable traveling bands can be obtained by varying the cell height. Similarly, for flow bounded by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a no-slip wall, the crystallites are characterized by a continuous out-of-plane flux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges, thereby stabilizing them. At an interface where the tangential stress vanishes, the crystallites are strictly 2D, with no out-of-plane flux. We rationalize these experimental results by calculating, in each case, the slow viscous flow produced by the droplets and the long-ranged, many-body active forces and torques between them. The results of numerical simulations of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in excellent agreement with experiments. Our work elucidates the mechanism of flow-induced phase separation in active fluids, particularly active colloidal suspensions, and demonstrates its control by boundaries, suggesting routes to geometric and topological phenomena in an active matter.},

The filaments can exist in different polymorphic forms, having distinct values of curvature and twist. Rotation rates are on the order of 100 Hz. In the past, the motion of individual filaments has been visualized by dark-field or differential-interference-contrast microscopy, methods hampered by intense scattering from the cell body or shallow depth of field, respectively. We have found a simple procedure for fluorescently labeling cells and filaments that allows recording their motion in real time with an inexpensive video camera and an ordinary fluorescence microscope with mercury-arc or strobed laser illumination. We report our initial findings with cells of               Escherichia coli               . Tumbles (events that enable swimming cells to alter course) are remarkably varied. Not every filament on a cell needs to change its direction of rotation: different filaments can change directions at different times, and a tumble can result from the change in direction of only one. Polymorphic transformations tend to occur in the sequence normal, semicoiled, curly 1, with changes in the direction of movement of the cell body correlated with transformations to the semicoiled form.},

We provide an experimental approach and theoretical framework for measuring the mechanical properties of live bacteria. We encapsulated bacteria in agarose with a user-defined stiffness, measured the growth rate of individual cells, and fit data to a thin-shell mechanical model to extract the effective longitudinal Young's modulus of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli (50\textendash 150 MPa), Bacillus subtilis (100\textendash 200 MPa), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100\textendash 200 MPa). Our data provide estimates of cell wall stiffness similar to values obtained via the more labor-intensive technique of atomic force microscopy. To address physiological perturbations that produce changes in cellular mechanical properties, we tested the effect of A22-induced MreB depolymerization on the stiffness of E. coli. The effective longitudinal Young's modulus was not significantly affected by A22 treatment at short time scales, supporting a model in which the interactions between MreB and the cell wall persist on the same time scale as growth. Our technique therefore enables the rapid determination of how changes in genotype and biochemistry affect the mechanical properties of the bacterial envelope.},

Using the geometry of a sessile drop, we demonstrate in suspensions of Bacillus subtilis the self-organized generation of a persistent hydrodynamic vortex that traps cells near the contact line. Arising from upward oxygentaxis and downward gravitational forcing, these dynamics are related to the Boycott effect in sedimentation and are explained quantitatively by a mathematical model consisting of oxygen diffusion and consumption, chemotaxis, and viscous fluid dynamics. The vortex is shown to advectively enhance uptake of oxygen into the suspension, and the wedge geometry leads to a singularity in the chemotactic dynamics near the contact line.},

Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the information character of biotic and abiotic matter\textemdash a broadly applicable physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii) we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we recount recent investigations into the structure of tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene, showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from informational materials science may impact biology.},

Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

Self-organization of active entities, leading to novel phases and emergent macroscopic properties, recently shed new light on these complex dynamical processes. Here we show that under the application of a constant magnetic field, motile magnetotactic bacteria confined in water-in-oil droplets self-assemble into a rotary motor exerting a torque on the external oil phase. A collective motion in the form of a large-scale vortex, reversable by inverting the field direction, builds~up in the droplet with a vorticity perpendicular to the magnetic field. We study this collective organization at different concentrations, magnetic fields and droplet radii and reveal the formation of two torque-generating areas close to the droplet interface. We characterize quantitatively the mechanical energy extractable from this new biological and self-assembled motor.},

With one single degree of freedom, the angle of a rotating bundle of flagella, bacteria provide one of the simplest examples of locomotion in the living world. Here we show that a purely physical mechanism, depending on a hydrodynamic stability condition, is responsible for a confinement induced transition between two swimming states in               E. coli               . While in large channels bacteria always crash onto confining walls, when the cross section falls below a threshold, they leave the walls to move swiftly on a stable swimming trajectory along the channel axis. We investigate this phenomenon for individual cells that are guided through a sequence of micro-fabricated tunnels of decreasing cross section. Our results challenge current theoretical predictions and suggest effective design principles for microrobots by showing that motility based on helical propellers provides a robust swimming strategy for exploring narrow spaces.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic particles are common in many industrial and natural turbulent flows. When these particles are small and neutrally buoyant, they follow Lagrangian trajectories while exhibiting rich orientational dynamics from the coupling of their rotation to the velocity gradients of the turbulence field. This system has proven to be a fascinating application of the fundamental properties of velocity gradients in turbulence. When particles are not neutrally buoyant, they experience preferential concentration and very different preferential alignment than neutrally buoyant tracer particles. A vast proportion of the parameter range of anisotropic particles in turbulence is still unexplored, with most existing research focusing on the simple foundational cases of axisymmetric ellipsoids at low concentrations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in turbulent channel flow. Numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly comprehensive picture of alignment and rotation in these cases, and they provide an essential foundation for addressing more complex problems of practical importance. Macroscopic effects of nonspherical particle dynamics include preferential concentration in coherent structures and drag reduction by fiber suspensions. We review the models used to describe nonspherical particle motion, along with numerical and experimental methods for measuring particle dynamics.},

Here, we present a self-propelled particle system, consisting of half-gold-coated titania~(TiO               2               ) particles, in which we can quickly~and on-demand reverse the propulsion direction, by exploiting the different photocatalytic activities on both sides. We demonstrate that the reversal in propulsion direction changes the nature of the hydrodynamic interaction from attractive to repulsive and can drive the particle assemblies to undergo both fusion and fission transitions. Moreover, we show these active colloids can act as nucleation sites, and switch rapidly the interactions between active and passive particles, leading to reconfigurable assembly and disassembly. Our experiments are qualitatively described by a minimal hydrodynamic model.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments on the drying of colloidal films in confined thin rectangular geometries show an interesting new phenomenon: the delamination of the colloidal suspension from the cavity wall. The theory developed in this paper explains the phenomenon by applying the Griffith energy criteria to a poroelastic film of Hertzian spheres. Prior to delamination, flow due to drying compresses the film in the direction of flow and generates tension in the transverse direction. Delamination allows relaxation in both the transverse tensile stresses and the axial compression. Preliminary numerical solutions suggest that the elastic energy recovered should increase linearly with the length of the close-packed film. That suggests a simple analytical solution that predicts the advancing of the delamination as the length of the close-packed region increases and explains qualitatively the essential features of the phenomenon.},

Colloidal suspensions are compressed between a planar moving interface and a stationary substrate. In the BD simulations, we develop a new Energy Minimization Potential-Free (EMPF) algorithm to enforce the hard-sphere potential in confined systems and to accurately measure the stress profile. The interface moves either at a constant velocity               U               w               or               via               a constant imposed normal stress               {$\Sigma$}               e               .

With a constant interface velocity, thermodynamics drives the suspension behavior when Pe               U               {$\ll$} 1, and homogeneous crystallization appears when the gap spacing between the two boundaries pushes the volume fraction above the equilibrium phase boundary. In contrast, when Pe               U               {$\gg$} 1, local epitaxial crystal growth appears adjacent to the moving interface even for large gap sizes. Interestingly, the most amorphous film microstructures are found at moderate Pe               U               . The film stress profile develops sharp transitions and becomes step-like with growing P\'eclet number. With a constant imposed stress, the interface stops moving as the suspension pressure increases and the microstructural and mechanical behaviors are similar to the constant velocity case. Comparison with the simulations shows that the model accurately captures the stress on the moving interface, and quantitatively resolves the local stress and volume fraction distributions for low to moderate P\'eclet numbers. This work demonstrates the critical role of interface motion on the film microstructures and stresses.},

  abstract = {To swim, a bacterium pushes against the fluid within which it is immersed, generating fluid flow that dies off on a length scale comparable to the size of the bacterium. However, in dense colonies of bacteria, the bacteria are close enough that flow generated by swimming is substantial. For these cases, complex flows can arise due to the interaction and feedback between the bacteria and the fluid. Recent experiments on dense populations of swimming Bacillus subtilis have revealed a volume fractiondependent transition from random swimming to transient jet and vortex patterns in the bacteria/fluid mixture. The fluid motions that are observed are reminiscent of flows that are observed around translating objects at moderate to high Reynolds numbers. In this work, I present a two-phase model for the bacterial/fluid mixture. The model explains turbulent flows in terms of the dipole stress that the bacteria exert on the fluid, entropic elasticity due to the rod shape of each bacterium, and the torque on the bacteria due to fluid gradients. Solving the equations in two dimensions using realistic parameters, the model reproduces empirically observed velocity fields. Dimensional analysis provides scaling relations for the dependence of the characteristic scales on the model parameters.},

Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the self-organization principles that govern flow statistics in such nonequilibrium networks. Here we connect concepts from lattice field theory, graph theory, and transition rate theory to understand how topology controls dynamics in a generic model for actively driven flow on a network. Our combined theoretical and numerical analysis identifies symmetry-based rules that make it possible to classify and predict the selection statistics of complex flow cycles from the network topology. The conceptual framework developed here is applicable to a broad class of biological and nonbiological far-from-equilibrium networks, including actively controlled information flows, and establishes a correspondence between active flow networks and generalized ice-type models.},

The competition between energy consumption and dissipation imposes stringent physical constraints on the information transport in active flow networks, facilitating global optimization strategies that are not well understood. Here, we combine insights from recent microbial experiments with concepts from lattice-field theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to introduce a generic theoretical framework for active matter logic. Highlighting conceptual differences with classical and quantum computation, we demonstrate how the inherent non-locality of incompressible active flow networks can be utilized to construct universal logical operations, Fredkin gates and memory storage in set\textendash reset latches through the synchronized self-organization of many individual network components. Our work lays the conceptual foundation for developing autonomous microfluidic transport devices driven by bacterial fluids, active liquid crystals or chemically engineered motile colloids.},

More recently, electronic forms of computation and information processing have overtaken these mechanical forms, owing to better potential for miniaturization and integration. However, several unconventional computing approaches have recently been introduced, which blend ideas of information processing, materials science and robotics. This has raised the possibility of new mechanical computing~systems that augment traditional electronic computing by interacting with and adapting to their environment. Here we discuss the use of mechanical mechanisms, and associated nonlinearities, as a means of processing information, with a view towards a framework in which adaptable materials and structures act as a distributed information processing network, even enabling information processing to be viewed as a material property, alongside traditional material properties such as strength and stiffness. We focus on approaches to abstract digital logic in mechanical systems, discuss how these systems differ from traditional electronic computing, and highlight the challenges and opportunities that they present.},

The active bath is either explicitly simulated by an ensemble of active Brownian particles or abstractly represented by an active colored noise in theory. Assuming the equivalence of the two descriptions of the active bath, the active noise in the simulation system, which is directly extracted by fitting theoretical predictions to simulation measurements, is shown to depend on the constraint suffered by the passive tracer. This scenario is in significant contrast to the case of thermal noise that is independent of external trap potentials. The constraint dependence of active noise arises from the fact that the persistent force on the passive particle from the active bath can be influenced by the particle relaxation dynamics. Moreover, due to the interplay between the active collisions and particle relaxation dynamics, the effective temperature of the passive tracer quantified as the ratio of fluctuation to dissipation increases as the constraint strengthens, while the average potential and kinetic energies of the passive particle both decrease.},

Here, we show that the bacterium Escherichia coli with a wide range of length speeds up beyond its free-swimming speed when passing through narrow and short confinement. The speedup is observed in two modes: For short bacteria with L{$<$}20{$\mu$}m, the maximum speed occurs when the cell body leaves the confinement but a flagellar bundle is still confined; For longer bacteria (L{$\geq$}20{$\mu$}m), the maximum speed occurs when the middle of the cell, where the maximum number of flagellar bundles locate, is confined. The two speedup modes are explained by a vanishing body drag and an increased flagella drag \textemdash{} a universal property of an 'ideal swimmer'. The spatial variance of speed can be quantitatively explained by a simple model based on the resistance matrix of a partially confined bacterium. The speed change depends on the distribution of motors and the latter is confirmed by fluorescent imaging of flagellar hooks. By measuring the duration of slowdown and speedup, we find that the effective chemotaxis is biased in filamentous bacteria which might benefit their survival. The experimental setup can be useful to study the motion of microswimmers near surfaces with different surface chemistry.},

Various issues interact here, such as dynamics of the contact line, evaporation-induced phase transitions, and formation of patterns. The explanation of the rich variety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge, but also a problem of practical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and improvement of coating/printing technology. The multi-scale aspect of the problem is emphasized in this review. The specific fundamental problem to be solved, related to the system is the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and evolution of phase fronts and the identification of mechanisms of pattern formation. To understand these problems, we introduce the important forces and interactions involved in these processes, and highlight the evaporation-driven phase transitions and flows in the drop. We focus on how the deposited patterns are related to and tuned by important factors, for instance substrate properties and contents of the drop. In addition, the formation of crust and crack patterns are discussed. The simulation and modeling methods, which are often utilized in this topic, are also reviewed. Finally, we summarize the applications of drop evaporation and suggest several potential directions for future research in this area. Exploiting the full potential of this topic in basic science research and applications needs involvement and interaction between scientists and engineers from disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and other related fields.},

  abstract = {The cracking behavior accompanied with the drying of colloidal droplets containing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles was studied. During evaporation, due to the stretching effect of the liquid zone, the receding wet front leads to the formation of radialized surface wrinkling in the gel zone. This indicates the building of a macroscopic stress field with a similar distribution. As a result, the cracks in the deposited films are in a radial arrangement. The propagation velocity of the cracks depends on the thickness of the film, {$\sim$} H3/5. In addition, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) additives can be used to tune crack behavior by causing a reduction of the capillary force between particles. The results highlight the significance of the receding wet front in building the drying deposition stress field and may be helpful in other fields related to drying and cracking processes.},

The flow velocity gradient over the length of polymer chains can be nonuniform and continuum models of polymeric liquids break in this limit. In this work, we use Brownian dynamics simulations to study a rotating helical flagellum in a polymer solution and overcome this limitation. As the polymer size increases, the viscosity experienced by the flagellum asymptotically reduces to the solvent viscosity. The contribution of polymer molecules to the local viscosity in a solution of long polymer chains decreases with the inverse of polymer size to the power 1/2. The difference in viscosity experienced by the bacterial cell body and flagella can predict the nonmonotonic swimming speed of bacteria in polymer solutions.},

In this paper, we studied the evaporation and pattern formation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) colloid droplets on smooth substrate and rough substrates with different roughness. We found that the evaporation of droplets shows remarkable coffee-ring effect on smooth substrate and that the cross-section of the ring is wedge-shaped with its thickness decreasing from the edge to the center. However, with increasing roughness, the effect strengthened, with the section of the coffee-ring changing from wedge- to hill-shaped. The contact angle decreased with increasing roughness, leading to an increase in evaporation rate. Moreover, wicking led to additional evaporation, which also enhanced capillary flow, moving more particles to the edge. In addition, the rough structure of the substrate inhibited the back-flow of the capillary flow, preventing the particles' move to the center. The formation of radial wrinkles on the edge also led to particle retention, preventing them from moving to the center. All these factors contribute to the decreased width and increased height of the coffee-ring pattern after evaporation on rough surfaces. It is an effective method to regulate the deposition pattern of evaporating droplet by changing the substrate roughness.},

  abstract = {An active colloidal fluid composed of self-propelled spinning particles injecting energy and angular momentum at the microscale demonstrates spontaneous collective states that range from flocks to coherent vortices. Despite their seeming simplicity, the emergent far-from-equilibrium behavior of these fluids remains poorly understood, presenting a challenge to the design and control of next-generation active materials. When confined in a ring, such so-called polar active fluids acquire chirality once the spontaneous flow chooses a direction. In a perfect ring, this chirality is indefinitely long-lived. Here, we combine experiments on self-propelled colloidal Quincke rollers and mesoscopic simulations of continuum Toner-Tu equations to explore how such chiral states can be controlled and manipulated by obstacles. For different obstacle geometries, three dynamic steady states have been realized: long-lived chiral flow, an apolar state in which the flow breaks up into counter-rotating vortices, and an unconventional collective state with flow having an oscillating chirality. The chirality reversal proceeds through the formation of intermittent vortex chains in the vicinity of an obstacle. We demonstrate that the frequency of collective states with oscillating chirality can be tuned by obstacle parameters. We vary obstacle shapes to design chiral states that are independent of initial conditions. Building on our findings, we realize a system with two triangular obstacles that force the active fluid toward a state with a density imbalance of active particles across the ring. Our results demonstrate how spontaneous polar active flows in combination with size and geometry of scatterers can be used to control dynamic patterns of polar active liquids for materials design.},

The complexity of the accessible dynamic states is expected to dramatically increase in the case of chiral active units. Here, we use shape anisotropy of colloidal particles to introduce chiral rollers with activity-controlled curvatures of their trajectories and spontaneous handedness of their motion. By controlling activity through variations of the energizing electric field, we reveal emergent dynamic phases, ranging from a gas of spinners to aster-like vortices and rotating flocks, with either polar or nematic alignment of the particles. We demonstrate control and reversibility of these dynamic states by activity. Our findings provide insights into the onset of spatial and temporal coherence in a broad class of active chiral systems, both living and synthetic, and hint at design pathways for active materials based on self-organization and reconfigurability.},

Here, we reveal that a global vortex formed by colloidal rollers exhibits polar state reversal and that a subsequent formation of the collective states upon re-energizing the system is not random. We combine experiments and simulations to elucidate how a combination of hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions leads to hidden asymmetries in the local particle positional order, reflecting the chiral state of the system. These asymmetries can be exploited to systematically command subsequent polar states of active liquids through temporal control of the activity.},

  abstract = {Flagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis exhibit effective mechanisms for swimming in fluids and exploring the surrounding environment. In isotropic fluids such as water, the bacteria change swimming direction through the run-and-tumble process. Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) have been introduced recently as an anisotropic environment in which the direction of preferred orientation, the director, guides the bacterial trajectories. In this work, we describe the behavior of bacteria B. subtilis in a homeotropic LCLC geometry, in which the director is perpendicular to the bounding plates of a shallow cell. We demonstrate that the bacteria are capable of overcoming the stabilizing elastic forces of the LCLC and swim perpendicularly to the imposed director (and parallel to the bounding plates). The effect is explained by a finite surface anchoring of the director at the bacterial body; the role of surface anchoring is analyzed by numerical simulations of a rod realigning in an otherwise uniform director field. Shear flows produced by a swimming bacterium cause director distortions around its body, as evidenced both by experiments and numerical simulations. These distortions contribute to a repulsive force that keeps the swimming bacterium at a distance of a few micrometers away from the bounding plates. The homeotropic alignment of the director imposes two different scenarios of bacterial tumbling: one with an 180\textdegree{} reversal of the horizontal velocity and the other with the realignment of the bacterium by two consecutive 90\textdegree{} turns. In the second case, the angle between the bacterial body and the imposed director changes from 90\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree{} and then back to 90\textdegree; the new direction of swimming does not correlate with the previous swimming direction. Introduction and background. Flagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis exhibit effective mechanisms for swimming. These bacteria explore the isotropic fluid environment such as water by a run-and-tumble mode of swimming. Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) have been introduced recently as an anisotropic environment that guides the bacteria to swim along the director, i.e. the axis of the liquid crystal alignment. Main result(s). In this work, we demonstrate that B. subtilis can also swim perpendicularly to the director, when placed in the so-called homeotropic cells, in which the director is perpendicular to the bounding plates. The ability of the bacteria to overcome the stabilizing elastic forces of the LCLC is explained by a relatively weak surface anchoring of the director at the bacterial body. Shear flows produced by a swimming bacterium cause quadrupolar distortions of the surrounding LCLC. These distortions stabilize the horizontal orientation of the bacterium and repel it from the bounding plates. The homeotropic alignment of the director imposes two different scenarios of bacterial tumbling: one with an 180\textdegree{} reversal of the horizontal velocity and the other with the realignment of the bacterium by flip-flops. Wider implications. The experiments demonstrate that the dynamic activity of bacteria can be effectively controlled by the surrounding anisotropic environment, thus opening opportunities for designing spatiotemporal behavior and development of materials and systems with an efficient transformation of chemical energy into sustained mechanical motion and useful work.

Perpendicular or parallel orientations to the surface lead to dipole-like or quadrupole-like defect structures. However, the so-called elastic hexadecapole discovered recently, has been assumed to result from a conic anchoring condition. In order to understand it at a fundamental level, a model for this anchoring is introduced here in the context of a Landau-de Gennes free energy functional. We investigate the evolution of defect configurations, as well as colloidal interactions, by tuning the preferred tilt angle (\texttheta e). The model predicts an elastic dipole whose stability decreases as \texttheta e increases, along with a dipole-hexadecapole transformation, which are confirmed by our experimental observations. Taken together, our results suggest that previously unanticipated avenues may exist for design of self-assembled structures via control of tilt angle.},

Methods for droplet generation can be either passive or active, where the former generates droplets without external actuation, and the latter makes use of additional energy input in promoting interfacial instabilities for droplet generation. A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms. Also included in this review is the contrast among different approaches of either passive or active nature.},
